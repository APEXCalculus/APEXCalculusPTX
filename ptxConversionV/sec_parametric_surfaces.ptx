  <title>Parametrized Surfaces and Surface Area</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Thus far we have focused mostly on 2-dimensional vector fields,
      measuring flow and flux along/across curves in the plane.
      Both Green's Theorem and the Divergence Theorem make connections between planar regions and their boundaries.
      We now move our attention to 3-dimensional vector fields,
      considering both curves and surfaces in space.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are accustomed to describing surfaces as functions of two variables,
      usually written as <m>z=f(x,y)</m>.
      For our coming needs,
      this method of describing surfaces will prove to be insufficient.
      Instead, we will <em>parametrize</em> our surfaces,
      describing them as the set of terminal points of some vector<ndash />valued function <m>\vec r(u,v) =\langle f(u,v),g(u,v),h(u,v)\rangle</m>.
      The bulk of this section is spent practicing the skill of describing a surface \mathcal{S}<nbsp />using a vector<ndash />valued function.
      Once this skill is developed,
      we'll show how to find the surface area <m>S</m> of a parametrically<ndash />defined surface \mathcal{S}, a skill needed in the remaining sections of this chapter.

    <aside>
      <p>
        <em>Note:</em> We use the letter <m>S</m> to denote Surface Area.
        This section begins a study into surfaces,
        and it is natural to label a surface with the letter <q>S</q>.
        We distinguish a surface from its surface area by using a calligraphic S to denote a surface: \mathcal{S}. When writing this letter by hand,
        it may be useful to add serifs to the letter, such as:

          Let <m>\vec r(u,v) = \langle\, f(u,v),g(u,v),h(u,v)\rangle</m> be a vector<ndash />valued function that is continuous and one to one on the interior of its domain <m>R</m> in the <m>u</m>-<m>v</m> plane.

        <em>Note:</em> A function is <em>one to one</em>
        on its domain if the function never repeats an output value over the domain.
        In the case of <m>\vec r(u,v)</m>,
        <m>\vec r</m> is one to one if <m>\vec r(u_1,v_1) \neq \vec r(u_2,v_2)</m> for all points

      Given a point <m>(u_0,v_0)</m> in the domain of a vector<ndash />valued function <m>\vec r</m>,
      the vectors <m>\vec r_u(u_0,v_0)</m> and
      <m>\vec r_v(u_0,v_0)</m> are tangent to the surface \mathcal{S}<nbsp />at
      <m>\vec r(u_0,v_0)</m> (a proof of this is developed later in this section).
      The definition of smoothness dictates that <m>\vec r_u\times \vec r_v \neq \vec 0</m>;
      this ensures that neither <m>\vec r_u</m> nor <m>\vec r_v</m> are <m>\vec 0</m>,
      nor are they ever parallel.
      Therefore smoothness guarantees that <m>\vec r_u</m> and
      <m>\vec r_v</m> determine a plane that is tangent to \mathcal{S}.

    <p>
      A surface \mathcal{S}<nbsp />is said to be <em>orientable</em>
          <idx><h>orientable</h></idx>
      if a field of normal vectors can be defined on \mathcal{S}<nbsp />that vary continuously along \mathcal{S}. This definition may be hard to understand;
      it may help to know that orientable surfaces are often called <q>two sided.</q>
      A sphere is an orientable surface,
      and one can easily envision an <q>inside</q>
      and <q>outside</q> of the sphere.
      A paraboloid is orientable,
      where again one can generally envision
      <q>inside</q> and <q>outside</q> sides
      (or <q>top</q> and <q>bottom</q> sides)
      to this surface.
      Just about every surface that one can imagine is orientable,
      and we'll assume all surfaces we deal with in this text are orientable.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is enlightening to examine a classic non-orientable surface:
      the M&#xf6;bius band,
          <idx><h>M&#xf6;bius band</h></idx>
      shown in <xref ref="fig_mobius">Figure</xref>.
      Vectors normal to the surface are given,
      starting at the point indicated in the figure.
      These normal vectors <q>vary continuously</q>
      as they move along the surface.
      Letting each vector indicate the
      <q>top</q> side of the band,
      we can easily see near any vector which side is the <q>top</q>.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if as we progress along the band,
      we recognize that we are labeling
      <q>both sides</q> of the band as the top;
      in fact, there are not two <q>sides</q> to this band, but one.
      The M&#xf6;bius band is a non-orientable surface.

        <p>
          There is a straightforward way to parametrize a surface of the form
          <m>z=f(x,y)</m> over a rectangular domain.
          We let <m>x=u</m> and <m>y=v</m>,

      <solution>
        <p>
          We can parametrize the circular boundary of <m>R</m> with the vector<ndash />valued function <m>\la 2\cos u,2\sin u\ra</m>,
          where <m>0\leq u\leq 2\pi</m>.
          We can obtain the interior of <m>R</m> by scaling this function by a variable amount,
          i.e., by multiplying by <m>v</m>:
          <m>\la 2v\cos u,2v\sin u\ra</m>,

          It is important to understand the role of <m>v</m> in the above function.

          the center of <m>R</m>
          (which can be thought of as a circle with radius of 0).
          When <m>v=1/2</m>,
          we get the circle of radius <m>1</m> that is centered at the origin,

        <p>
          Thus far, we have determined the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> components of our parametrization of the surface:
          <m>x=2v\cos u</m> and <m>y=2v\sin u</m>.
          We find the <m>z</m> component simply by using <m>z = f(x,y) = x^2+2y^2</m>:
          <me>
            z = (2v\cos u)^2+2(2v\sin u)^2 = 4v^2\cos^2u+8v^2\sin^2u
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus <m>\vec r(u,v) = \langle 2v\cos u,2v\sin u,4v^2\cos^2u+8v^2\sin^2u\rangle</m>,
          <m>0\leq u\leq 2\pi</m>, <m>0\leq v\leq 1</m>,
          which is graphed in <xref ref="fig_parsurf2">Figure</xref>.
          The way that this graphic was generated highlights how the surface was parametrized.
          When viewing from above, one can see lines emanating from the origin;
          they represent different values of <m>u</m> as <m>u</m> sweeps from an angle of 0 up to <m>2\pi</m>.
          One can also see concentric circles,
          each corresponding to a different value of <m>v</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      <xref ref="ex_parsurf1">Examples</xref>
      and <xref ref="ex_parsurf2"></xref>
      demonstrate an important principle when parameterizing surfaces given in the form
      <m>z=f(x,y)</m> over a region <m>R</m>:
      if one can determine <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in terms of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>,
      then <m>z</m> follows directly as <m>z=f(x,y)</m>.

    <p>
      In the following two examples,
      we parametrize the same surface over triangular regions.
      Each will use <m>v</m> as a <q>scaling factor</q>
      as done in <xref ref="ex_parsurf2">Example</xref>.

          While the region <m>R</m> in this example is very similar to the region <m>R</m> in the previous example,
          and our method of parameterizing the surface is fundamentally the same,
          it will feel as though our answer is much different than before.
        </p>

        <p>
          We begin with letting <m>x=u</m>, <m>0\leq u\leq 3</m>.
          We may be tempted to let <m>y = v(3-2u/3)</m>,
          <m>0\leq v\leq 1</m>, but this is incorrect.
          When <m>v = 1</m>,
          we obtain the upper line of the triangle as desired.
          However, when <m>v=0</m>,
          the <m>y</m>-value is 0, which does not lie in the region <m>R</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will describe the general method of proceeding following this example.
          For now, consider <m>y = 1+v(2-2u/3)</m>, <m>0\leq v\leq 1</m>.
          Note that when <m>v=1</m>,
          we have <m>y=3-2u/3</m>, the upper line of the boundary of <m>R</m>.
          Also, when <m>v=0</m>, we have <m>y=1</m>,
          which is the lower boundary of <m>R</m>.
          With <m>z=x^2+2y^2</m>,
          we determine <m>\vec r(u,v) = \langle u, 1+v(2-2u/3),
          u^2+2\big(1+v(2-2u/3)\big)^2\rangle</m>,

    <p>
      Given a surface of the form <m>z=f(x,y)</m>,
      one can often determine a parametrization of the surface over a region <m>R</m> in a manner similar to determining bounds of integration over a region <m>R</m>.
      Using the techniques of <xref ref="sec_iterated_integrals">Section</xref>,
      suppose a region <m>R</m> can be described by <m>a\leq x\leq b</m>,
      <m>g_1(x) \leq y\leq g_2(x)</m>,
      i.e., the area of <m>R</m> can be found using the iterated integral
      <me>
        \int_a^b\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)}\ dy\ dx
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When parameterizing the surface,
      we can let <m>x=u</m>, <m>a\leq u\leq b</m>,
      and we can let <m>y = g_1(u)+v\big(g_2(u)-g_1(u)\big)</m>,
      <m>0\leq v\leq 1</m>.
      The parametrization of <m>x</m> is straightforward,
      but look closely at how <m>y</m> is determined.
      When <m>v=0</m>, <m>y=g_1(u) = g_1(x)</m>.
      When <m>v=1</m>, <m>y= g_2(u)=g_2(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a specific example,
      consider the triangular region <m>R</m> from <xref ref="ex_parsurf4">Example</xref>,
      shown in <xref ref="fig_parsurf4">Figure</xref>(a).
      Using the techniques of <xref ref="sec_iterated_integrals">Section</xref>,
      we can find the area of <m>R</m> as
      <me>
        \int_0^3\int_1^{3-2x/3} dy\ dx
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following the above discussion,
      we can set <m>x=u</m>, where <m>0\leq u\leq 3</m>,
      and set <m>y = 1+ v\big(3-2u/3-1\big) = 1+v(2-2u/3)</m>,
      <m>0\leq v\leq 1</m>, as used in that example.
    </p>

    <p>
      One can do a similar thing if <m>R</m> is bounded by <m>c\leq y\leq d</m>,
      <m>h_1(y)\leq x\leq h_2(y)</m>,
      but for the sake of simplicity we leave it to the reader to flesh out those details.
      The principles outlined above are given in the following Key Idea for reference.

          If we choose our angles appropriately,

          The <m>x</m>-radius of the given ellipsoid is 5, the <m>y</m>-radius is 1 and the <m>z</m>-radius is 2.
          Substituting <m>u</m> for <m>\theta</m> and <m>v</m> for <m>\varphi</m>,
          we have <m>\vec r(u,v) = \langle 5\sin u\cos v, \sin u\sin v,2\cos u\rangle</m>,

          This hints at the fact that ellipses are drawn parallel to the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane as <m>v</m> varies,

      Parametrization is a powerful way to represent surfaces.
      One of the advantages of the methods of parametrization described in this section is that the domain of
      <m>\vec r(u,v)</m> is always a rectangle;
      that is, the bounds on <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are constants.
      This will make some of our future computations easier to evaluate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as we could parametrize curves in more than one way,
      there will always be multiple ways to parametrize a surface.
      Some ways will be more <q>natural</q> than others,
      but these other ways are not incorrect.
      Because technology is often readily available,
      it is often a good idea to check one's work by graphing a parametrization of a surface to check if it indeed represents what it was intended to.

  <subsection>
    <title>Surface Area</title>
    <p>
      It will become important in the following sections to be able to compute the surface area of a surface \mathcal{S}<nbsp />given a smooth parametrization <m>\vec r(u,v)</m>,
      <m>a\leq u\leq b</m>, <m>c\leq v\leq d</m>.
      Following the principles given in the integration review at the beginning of this chapter,
      we can say that<idx><h>surface area</h><h>of parametrized surface</h></idx>
      <me>
        \text{ Surface Area of \surfaceS } =S = \iint_{\surfaceS}\ dS
      </me>,
      where <m>dS</m> represents a small amount of surface area.
      That is, to compute total surface area <m>S</m>,
      add up lots of small amounts of surface area <m>dS</m> across the entire surface \mathcal{S}. The key to finding surface area is knowing how to compute <m>dS</m>.
      We begin by approximating.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_surface_area">Section</xref>
      we used the area of a plane to approximate the surface area of a small portion of a surface.
      We will do the same here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>R</m> be the region of the <m>u</m>-<m>v</m> plane bounded by <m>a\leq u\leq b</m>,
      <m>c\leq v\leq d</m> as shown in <xref ref="fig_parsurfarea">Figure</xref>(a).
      Partition <m>R</m> into rectangles of width
      <m>\Delta u = \frac{b-a}n</m> and height <m>\Delta v = \frac{d-c}n</m>,
      for some <m>n</m>.
      Let <m>p=(u_0,v_0)</m> be the lower left corner of some rectangle in the partition,
      and let <m>m</m> and <m>q</m> be neighboring corners as shown.
    </p>

    <p>
      The point <m>p</m> maps to a point
      <m>P = \vec r(u_0,v_0)</m> on the surface \mathcal{S}, and the rectangle with corners <m>p</m>,
      <m>m</m> and <m>q</m> maps to some region
      (probably not rectangular)
      on the surface as shown in <xref ref="fig_parsurfarea">Figure</xref>(b),
      where <m>M = \vec r(m)</m> and <m>Q = \vec r(q)</m>.
      We wish to approximate the surface area of this mapped region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>\vec u = M-P</m> and <m>\vec v = Q-P</m>.
      These two vectors form a parallelogram,
      illustrated in <xref ref="fig_parsurfarea">Figure</xref>(c),
      whose area <em>approximates</em>
      the surface area we seek.
      In this particular illustration,
      we can see that parallelogram does not particularly match well the region we wish to approximate,
      but that is acceptable;
      by increasing the number of partitions of <m>R</m>,
      <m>\Delta u</m> and <m>\Delta v</m> shrink and our approximations will become better.
    </p>

    <p>
      From <xref ref="sec_cross_product">Section</xref>
      we know the area of this parallelogram is <m>\snorm{\vec u\times \vec v}</m>.
      If we repeat this approximation process for each rectangle in the partition of <m>R</m>,
      we can sum the areas of all the parallelograms to get an approximation of the surface area <m>S</m>:
      <me>
        \text{ Surface area of \surfaceS }  =S \approx \sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^n \snorm{\vec u_{i,j}\times \vec v_{i,j}}
      </me>,
      where <m>\vec u_{i,j} = \vec r(u_i+\Delta u,v_j) - \vec r(u_i,v_j)</m> and <m>\vec v_{i,j} = \vec r(u_i,v_j+\Delta v)-\vec r(u_i,v_j)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      From our previous calculus experience,
      we expect that taking a limit as
      <m>n\to \infty</m> will result in the exact surface area.
      However, the current form of the above double sum makes it difficult to realize what the result of that limit is.
      The following rewriting of the double summation will be helpful:
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp \sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^n \snorm{\vec u_{i,j}\times \vec v_{i,j}}=</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^n \snorm{\big(\vec r(u_i+\Delta u,v_j) - \vec r(u_i,v_j)\big) \times \big(\vec r(u_i,v_j+\Delta v)-\vec r(u_i,v_j)\big)}=</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^n \snorm{\frac{\vec r(u_i+\Delta u,v_j) - \vec r(u_i,v_j)}{\Delta u} \times \frac{\vec r(u_i,v_j+\Delta v)-\vec r(u_i,v_j)}{\Delta v}}\Delta u\Delta v</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now take the limit as <m>n\to\infty</m>,
      forcing <m>\Delta u</m> and <m>\Delta v</m> to 0.
      As <m>\Delta u\to 0</m>,
      <me>
        \frac{\vec r(u_i+\Delta u,v_j) - \vec r(u_i,v_j)}{\Delta u} \to \vec r_u(u_i,v_j) \text{ and }
      </me>
      <me>
        \frac{\vec r(u_i,v_j+\Delta v)-\vec r(u_i,v_j)}{\Delta v} \to \vec r_v(u_i,v_j)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      (This limit process also demonstrates that <m>\vec r_u(u,v)</m> and
      <m>\vec r_v(u,v)</m> are tangent to the surface \mathcal{S}<nbsp />at <m>\vec r(u,v)</m>.
      We don't need this fact now, but it will be important in the next section.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, in the limit, the double sum leads to a double integral:
      <me>
        \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^n \snorm{\vec u_{i,j}\times \vec v_{i,j}}= \int_c^d\int_a^b \snorm{\vec r_u\times\vec r_v}\ du\ dv
      </me>.

        <p>
          In <xref ref="ex_parsurf2">Example</xref>,
          we parametrized the surface as <m>\vec r(u,v) = \la 2v\cos u, 2v\sin u, 4v^2\cos^2u+8v^2\sin^2u\ra</m>,
          for <m>0\leq u\leq 2\pi</m>, <m>0\leq v\leq 1</m>.

      part of the differential canceled out of the integrand
      (to our benefit,
      as integrating the square roots of functions is generally difficult).
      We will find a similar thing happens when we use the surface area differential <m>dS</m> in the following sections.
      That is, our main goal is not to be able to compute surface area;
      rather, surface area is a tool to obtain other quantities that are more important and useful.
      In our applications, we will use <m>dS</m>,
      but most of the time the <q><m>\snorm{\vec r_u\times \vec r_v}</m></q>
