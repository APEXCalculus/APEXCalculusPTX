  <title>Introduction to Line Integrals</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We first used integration to find
      <q>area under a curve.</q> In this section,
      we learn to do this (again), but in a different context.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the surface and curve shown in <xref ref="fig_lineint0">Figure</xref>(a).
      The surface is given by <m>f(x,y)=1-\cos(x)\sin(y)</m>.
      The dashed curve lies in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane and is the familiar <m>y=x^2</m> parabola from <m>-1\leq x\leq1</m>;
      we'll call this curve <m>C</m>.
      The curve drawn with a solid line in the graph is the curve in space that lies on our surface with <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values that lie on <m>C</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question we want to answer is this:
      what is the area that lies below the curve drawn with the solid line?
      In other words,
      what is the area of the region above <m>C</m> and under the the surface <m>f</m>?
      This region is shown in <xref ref="fig_lineint0">Figure</xref>(b).
    </p>

    <p>
      We suspect the answer can be found using an integral,
      but before trying to figure out what that integral is,
      let us first try to approximate its value.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="fig_lineint0">Figure</xref>(c),
      four rectangles have been drawn over the curve <m>C</m>.
      The bottom corners of each rectangle lie on <m>C</m>,
      and each rectangle has a height given by the function <m>f(x,y)</m> for some <m>(x,y)</m> pair along <m>C</m> between the rectangle's bottom corners.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we know how to find the area of each rectangle,
      we are able to approximate the area above <m>C</m> and under <m>f</m>.
      Clearly, our approximation will be
      <em>an approximation</em>.
      The heights of the rectangles do not match exactly with the surface <m>f</m>,
      nor does the base of each rectangle follow perfectly the path of <m>C</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In typical calculus fashion,
      our approximation can be improved by using more rectangles.
      The sum of the areas of these rectangles gives an approximate value of the true area above <m>C</m> and under <m>f</m>.
      As the area of each rectangle is
      <q>height <times /> width</q>, we assert that the
      <me>
        \text{ area above \(C\) } \approx \sum (\text{ heights } \times\text{ widths } )
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When first learning of the integral,
      and approximating areas with <q>heights <times /> widths</q>,
      the width was a small change in <m>x</m>: <m>dx</m>.
      That will not suffice in this context.
      Rather, each width of a rectangle is actually approximating the arc length of a small portion of <m>C</m>.
      In <xref ref="sec_curvature">Section</xref>,
      we used <m>s</m> to represent the arc<ndash />length parameter of a curve.
      A small amount of arc length will thus be represented by <m>ds</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The height of each rectangle will be determined in some way by the surface <m>f</m>.
      If we parametrize <m>C</m> by <m>s</m>,
      an <m>s</m>-value corresponds to an <m>(x,y)</m> pair that lies on the parabola <m>C</m>.
      Since <m>f</m> is a function of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
      and <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are functions of <m>s</m>,
      we can say that <m>f</m> is a function of <m>s</m>.
      Given a value <m>s</m>, we can compute <m>f(s)</m> and find a height.
      Thus
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ area under \(f\) and above \(C\) } \amp \approx \sum (\text{ heights } \times\text{ widths } );</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{ area under \(f\) and above \(C\) }               \amp =\lim_{||\Delta s||\to0}\sum f(c_i)\Delta s_i</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\int_Cf(s)\ ds</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here we have introduce a new notation,
      the integral symbol with a subscript of <m>C</m>.
      It is reminiscent of our usage of <m>\iint_R</m>.
      Using the train of thought found in the Integration Review preceding this section,
      we interpret <q><m>\int_C f(s)\ ds</m></q>
      as meaning <q>sum up, along a curve <m>C</m>,
      function values <m>f(s)\times</m>small arc lengths.</q>
      It is understood here that <m>s</m> represents the arc<ndash />length parameter.
    </p>

    <p>
      All this leads us to a definition.
      The integral found in <xref ref="eq_line0">Equation</xref>
      is called a <em>line integral</em>.
      We formally define it below, but note that the definition is very abstract.
      On one hand,
      one is apt to say <q>the definition makes sense,</q> while on the other,
      one is equally apt to say <q>but I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this definition.</q>
      We'll address that after the definition,
      and actually find an answer to the area problem we posed at the beginning of this section.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def_line_integral1">
      <title>Line Integral Over A Scalar Field</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>C</m> be a smooth curve parametrized by <m>s</m>,
          the arc<ndash />length parameter,
          and let <m>f</m> be a continuous function of <m>s</m>.

      </statement>
    </definition>

    <aside>
      <p>
        <em>Note:</em> <xref ref="def_line_integral1">Definition</xref>
        uses the term <em>scalar field</em>
        which has not yet been defined.
        Its meaning is discussed in the paragraph preceding <xref ref="def_line_integral2">Definition</xref>
        when it is compared to a <em>vector field</em>.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      When <m>C</m> is a <em>closed</em> curve,
      i.e., a curve that ends at the same point at which it starts, we use
      <me>
        \oint_C f(s)\ ds  \text{ instead of }  \int_Cf(s)\ ds
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The definition of the line integral does not specify whether <m>C</m> is a curve in the plane or space
      (or hyperspace),
      as the definition holds regardless.
      For now, we'll assume <m>C</m> lies in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      This definition of the line integral doesn't really say anything new.
      If <m>C</m> is a curve and <m>s</m> is the arc<ndash />length parameter of <m>C</m> on <m>a\leq s\leq b</m>, then
      <me>
        \int_Cf(s)\ ds = \int_a^bf(s)\ ds
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real difference with this integral from the standard
      <q><m>\int_a^bf(x)\ dx</m></q>
      we used in the past is that of context.
      Our previous integrals naturally summed up values over an interval on the <m>x</m>-axis,
      whereas now we are summing up values over a curve.
      <em>If</em> we can parametrize the curve with the arc<ndash />length parameter,
      we can evaluate the line integral just as before.
      Unfortunately,
      parametrizing a curve in terms of the arc<ndash />length parameter is usually very difficult,
      so we must develop a method of evaluating line integrals using a different parametrization.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a curve <m>C</m>, find any parametrization of <m>C</m>:
      <m>x = g(t)</m> and <m>y=h(t)</m>,
      for continuous functions <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>,
      where <m>a\leq t\leq b</m>.
      We can represent this parametrization with a vector<ndash />valued function,
      <m>\vrt = \langle g(t),h(t)\rangle</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_curvature">Section</xref>,
      we defined the arc<ndash />length parameter in <xref ref="eq_vvfarc">Equation</xref> as
      <me>
        s(t) = \int_0^t \norm{\vec r\,'(u)}\ du
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
      <m>ds = \norm{\vec r\,'(t)}\ dt</m>.
      We can substitute the right hand side of this equation for <m>ds</m> in the line integral definition.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can view <m>f</m> as being a function of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> since it is a function of <m>s</m>.
      Thus <m>f(s) =f(x,y) =f\big(g(t),h(t)\big)</m>.
      This gives us a concrete way to evaluate a line integral:
      <me>
        \int_C f(s)\ ds = \int_a^bf\big(g(t),h(t)\big)\norm{\vec r\,'(t)}\ dt
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We restate this as a theorem,
      along with its three<ndash />dimensional analogue,
      followed by an example where we finally evaluate an integral and find an area.

    <p>
      To be clear,
      the first point of <xref ref="thm_line1">Theorem</xref>
      can be used to find the area under a surface
      <m>z=f(x,y)</m> and above a curve <m>C</m>.
      We will later give an understanding of the line integral when <m>C</m> is a curve in space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's do an example where we actually compute an area.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_linescalarfield2">
      <title>Evaluating a line integral: area under a surface over a curve.</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the area under the surface
          <m>f(x,y) =\cos(x)+\sin(y)+2</m> over the curve <m>C</m>,
          which is the segment of the line <m>y=2x+1</m> on <m>-1\leq x\leq 1</m>,
          as shown in <xref ref="fig_linescalarfield2">Figure</xref>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Our first step is to represent <m>C</m> with a vector<ndash />valued function.
          Since <m>C</m> is a simple line,
          and we have a explicit relationship between <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> (namely,
          that <m>y</m> is <m>2x+1</m>),
          we can let <m>x = t</m>, <m>y = 2t+1</m>,
          and write <m>\vrt = \langle t, 2t+1\rangle</m> for <m>-1\leq t\leq 1</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We find the values of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> as <m>f(x,y) = f(t,2t+1) = \cos(t)+\sin(2t+1) + 2</m>.
          We also need <m>\norm{\vec r\,'(t)}</m>;
          with <m>\vrp(t) = \langle 1,2\rangle</m>,
          we have <m>\norm{\vrp(t)} = \sqrt{5}</m>.
          Thus <m>ds = \sqrt{5}\ dt</m>.

          (Note: we may have approximated this answer from the start.
          The unit circle has a circumference of <m>2\pi</m>,

      <solution>
        <p>
          We parametrize our curve <m>C</m> as
          <m>\vrt = \langle t,t^2\rangle</m> for <m>-1\leq t\leq 1</m>;
          we find <m>\norm{\vrp(t)} = \sqrt{1+4t^2}</m>,

    <p>
      We give one more example of finding area.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_linescalarfield4">

        <p>
          We use the given vector-valued function \vec r(t)<nbsp />to determine the curve <m>C</m> in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane by simply using the first two components of \vec r(t):

          The height is not found by evaluating a surface over <m>C</m>,
          but rather it is given directly by the third component of \vec r(t):

            \oint_C f(s)\ ds = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{t}{\pi}\sqrt{\sin^2t + 4\cos^2t}\,dt \approx 9.69

      Note how in each of the previous examples we are effectively finding

      We have used the phrase <q>area <em>over</em>
      a curve <m>C</m> and under a surface,</q>
      but that is because of the important role <m>C</m> plays in the integral.
      The figures show how the curve <m>C</m> defines another curve on the surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m>,
      and we are finding the area under that curve.

  <subsection>
    <title>Properties of Line Integrals</title>
    <p>
      Many properties of line integrals can be inferred from general integration properties.
      For instance, if <m>k</m> is a scalar,
      then <m>\int_C k\,f(s)ds = k\int_Cf(s)ds</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      One property in particular of line integrals is worth noting.
      If <m>C</m> is a curve composed of subcurves <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m>,
      where they share only one point in common (see <xref ref="fig_line_int_prop">Figure</xref>(a)),
      then the line integral over <m>C</m> is the sum of the line integrals over <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m>:
      <me>
        \int_Cf(s)\ ds = \int_{C_1}f(s)\ ds+\int_{C_2}f(s)\ ds
      </me>.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      This property allows us to evaluate line integrals over some curves <m>C</m> that are not smooth.
      Note how in <xref ref="fig_line_int_prop">Figure</xref>(b) the curve is not smooth at <m>D</m>,
      so by our definition of the line integral we cannot evaluate <m>\int_C f(s)ds</m>.
      However, one can evaluate line integrals over <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> and their sum will be the desired quantity.
    </p>

    <p>
      A curve <m>C</m> that is composed of two or more smooth curves is said to be
      <em>piecewise smooth</em>.
      In this chapter,
      any statement that is made about smooth curves also holds for piecewise smooth curves.

    <title>Mass and Center of Mass</title>
    <p>
      We first learned integration as a method to find area under a curve,
      then later used integration to compute a variety of other quantities,
      such as arc length, volume, force, etc.
      In this section,
      we also introduced line integrals as a method to find area under a curve,
      and now we explore one more application.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let a curve <m>C</m>
      (either in the plane or in space)
      represent a thin wire with variable density <m>\delta(s)</m>.
      We can approximate the mass of the wire by dividing the wire (i.e., the curve) into small segments of length
      <m>\Delta s_i</m> and assume the density is constant across these small segments.
      The mass of each segment is density of the segment <times /> its length;
      by summing up the approximate mass of each segment we can approximate the total mass:
      <me>
        \text{ Total Mass of Wire }  = \sum \delta(s_i)\Delta s_i
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      By taking the limit as the length of the segments approaches 0, we have the definition of the line integral as seen in <xref ref="def_line_integral1">Definition</xref>.
      When learning of the line integral,
      we let <m>f(s)</m> represent a height;
      now we let <m>f(s) = \delta(s)</m> represent a density.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can extend this understanding of computing mass to also compute the center of mass of a thin wire.
      (As a reminder,
      the center of mass can be a useful piece of information as objects rotate about that center.)
      We give the relevant formulas in the next definition, followed by an example.
      Note the similarities between this definition and <xref ref="def_mass_3d">Definition</xref>,
      which gives similar properties of solids in space.

            (\overline{x},\overline{y},\overline{z}) = \left(\frac{M_{yz}}M, \frac{M_{xz}}M,\frac{M_{xy}}M\right) \approx (1,1.25,1.20)
          </me>,
          as indicated by the dot in <xref ref="fig_linescalarfield6">Figure</xref>.
          Note how in this example,
          the curve <m>C</m> is <q>centered</q>
          about the point <m>(1,1,1)</m>,
          though the variable density of the wire pulls the center of mass out along the <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> axes.

      We end this section with a callback to the Integration Review that preceded this section.
      A line integral looks like: <m>\int_C f(s)\ ds</m>.
      As stated before the definition of the line integral,
      this means <q>sum up, along a curve <m>C</m>,
      function values <m>f(s)</m> <times /> small arc lengths.</q>
      When <m>f(s)</m> represents a height,
      we have <q>height <times /> length = area.</q>
      When <m>f(s)</m> is a density (and we use
      <m>\delta(s)</m> by convention), we have <q>density
      (mass per unit length)
      <times /> length = mass.</q>

      In the next section, we investigate a new mathematical object,
      the <em>vector field</em>.
      The remaining sections of this chapter are devoted to understanding integration in the context of vector fields.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Explain how a line integral can be used to find the area under a curve.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          When <m>C</m> is a curve in the plane and <m>f</m> is a surface defined over <m>C</m>,
          then <m>\int_C f(s)\ ds</m> describes the area under the spatial curve that lies on <m>f</m>,
          over <m>C</m>.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How does the evaluation of a line integral given as
          <m>\int_C f(s)\ ds</m> differ from a line integral given as <m>\oint_C f(s)\ ds</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The evaluation is the same.
          The <m>\oint</m> notation signifies that the curve <m>C</m> is a closed curve,
          though the evaluation is the same.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Why are most line integrals evaluated using <xref ref="thm_line1">Key Idea</xref> instead of <q>directly</q>
          as <m>\int_C f(s)\ ds</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The variable <m>s</m> denotes the arc-length parameter,
          which is generally difficult to use.
          The Key Idea allows one to parametrize a curve using another,
          ideally easier-to-use, parameter.
