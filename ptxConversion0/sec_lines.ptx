      To find the equation of a line in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane,
      we need two pieces of information:
      a point and the slope.
      The slope conveys <em>direction</em> information.
      As vertical lines have an undefined slope,
      the following statement is more accurate:
    </p>

    To define a line, one needs a point on the line and the direction of the line.

    <p>
      This holds true for lines in space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>P</m> be a point in space,
      let <m>\vec p</m> be the vector with initial point at the origin and terminal point at <m>P</m> (i.e., <m>\vec p</m>
      <q>points</q> to <m>P</m>),
      and let <m>\vec d</m> be a vector.
      Consider the points on the line through <m>P</m> in the direction of <m>\vec d</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clearly one point on the line is <m>P</m>;
      we can say that the <em>vector</em>
      <m>\vec p</m> lies at this point on the line.
      To find another point on the line,
      we can start at <m>\vec p</m> and move in a direction parallel to <m>\vec d</m>.
      For instance,
      starting at <m>\vec p</m> and traveling one length of <m>\vec d</m> places one at another point on the line.
      Consider <xref ref="fig_lines_intro">Figure</xref>
      where certain points along the line are indicated.

    <p>
      The figure illustrates how every point on the line can be obtained by starting with <m>\vec p</m> and moving a certain distance in the direction of <m>\vec d</m>.
      That is, we can define the line as a function of <m>t</m>:
      <men xml:id="eq_lines1">
        \vec\ell(t) = \vec p + t\ \vec d
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In many ways, this is <em>not</em> a new concept.
      Compare Equation <xref ref="eq_lines1" /> to the familiar
      <q><m>y=mx+b</m></q> equation of a line:

      \captionof{figure}{Understanding the vector equation of a line.} The equations exhibit the same structure:
      they give a starting point,
      define a direction, and state how far in that direction to travel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Equation <xref ref="eq_lines1" /> is an example of a
      <em>vector<ndash />valued function</em>;
      the input of the function is a real number and the output is a vector.
      We will cover vector<ndash />valued functions extensively in the next chapter.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are other ways to represent a line.
      Let <m>\vec p = \la x_0,y_0,z_0\ra</m> and let <m>\vec d = \la a,b,c\ra</m>.
      Then the equation of the line through <m>\vec p</m> in the direction of <m>\vec d</m> is:
      <md>
        <mrow>\vec\ell(t) \amp = \vec p + t\vec d</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \la x_0,y_0,z_0\ra + t\la a,b,c\ra</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \la x_0 + at, y_0+bt, z_0+ct\ra</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The last line states that the <m>x</m> values of the line are given by <m>x=x_0+at</m>,
      the <m>y</m> values are given by <m>y = y_0+bt</m>,
      and the <m>z</m> values are given by <m>z = z_0 + ct</m>.
      These three equations, taken together,
      are the <em>parametric equations of the line</em>
      through <m>\vec p</m> in the direction of <m>\vec d</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, each of the equations for <m>x</m>,
      <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> above contain the variable <m>t</m>.
      We can solve for <m>t</m> in each equation:
      <md>
        <mrow>x = x_0+at \amp \Rightarrow t=\frac{x-x_0}{a},</mrow>
        <mrow>y=y_0+bt \amp \Rightarrow t = \frac{y-y_0}{b},</mrow>
        <mrow>z = z_0+ct \amp \Rightarrow t = \frac{z-z_0}{c}</mrow>
      </md>,
      assuming <m>a,b,c\neq 0</m>.
      Since <m>t</m> is equal to each expression on the right,
      we can set these equal to each other,
      forming the <em>symmetric equations of the line</em>
      through <m>\vec p</m> in the direction of <m>\vec d</m>:
      <me>
        \frac{x-x_0}{a} = \frac{y-y_0}{b}=\frac{z-z_0}{c}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each representation has its own advantages, depending on the context.
      We summarize these three forms in the following definition,
      then give examples of their use.

          The first two equations of the line are useful when a <m>t</m> value is given:
          one can immediately find the corresponding point on the line.
          These forms are good when calculating with a computer;
          most software programs easily handle equations in these formats. (For instance,
          to make <xref ref="fig_lines1">Figure</xref>,
          a certain graphics program was given the input <c>(2-x,3+x,1+2*x)</c>.
          This particular program requires the variable always be <q><m>x</m></q>
          instead of <q><m>t</m></q>).
        </p>

        <p>
          Does the point <m>Q = (-1,6,6)</m> lie on the line?
          The graph in <xref ref="fig_lines1">Figure</xref>
          makes it clear that it does not.
          We can answer this question without the graph using any of the three equation forms.
          Of the three,
          the symmetric equations are probably best suited for this task.
          Simply plug in the values of <m>x</m>,
          <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> and see if equality is maintained:
          <me>
            \frac{-1-2}{-1} \stackrel{?}{=} \frac{6-3}{1} \stackrel{?}{=} \frac{6-1}{2}  \Rightarrow  3=3\neq2.5
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We see that <m>Q</m> does not lie on the line as it did not satisfy the symmetric equations.

          We have <em>two</em> points;

      <em> Parallel, Intersecting and Skew Lines</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the plane, two <em>distinct</em>
      lines can either be parallel or they will intersect at exactly one point.
      In space, given equations of two lines,
      it can sometimes be difficult to tell whether the lines are distinct or not (i.e., the same line can be represented in different ways).
      Given lines <m>\vec\ell_1(t) = \vec p_1 + t\vec d_1</m> and <m>\vec \ell_2(t) = \vec p_2+t\vec d_2</m>,
      we have four possibilities:

          <idx><h>lines</h><h>skew</h></idx>
          <idx><h>lines</h><h>parallel</h></idx>

      skew lines &amp; <m>\vec d_1\nparallel \vec d_2</m>, no points in common.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We start by looking at the directions of each line.
          Line <m>\ell_1</m> has the direction given by
          <m>\vec d_1=\la 3,-1,1\ra</m> and line <m>\ell_2</m> has the direction given by <m>\vec d_2 = \la 4,1,2\ra</m>.
          It should be clear that <m>\vec d_1</m> and <m>\vec d_2</m> are not parallel,
          hence <m>\ell_1</m> and <m>\ell_2</m> are not the same line,
          nor are they parallel.
          <xref ref="fig_lines2">Figure</xref> verifies this fact

          We next check to see if they intersect
          (if they do not, they are skew lines).
          To find if they intersect,
          we look for <m>t</m> and <m>s</m> values such that the respective <m>x</m>,
          <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> values are the same.
          That is, we want <m>s</m> and <m>t</m> such that:

        <p>
          This is a relatively simple system of linear equations.
          Since the last equation is already solved for <m>t</m>,
          substitute that value of <m>t</m> into the equation above it:
          <me>
            2-(5+2s) = 3+s  \Rightarrow  s=-2,\ t=1
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A key to remember is that we have
          <em>three</em> equations;
          we need to check if <m>s=-2,\ t=1</m> satisfies the first equation as well:
          <me>
            1+3(1) \neq -2+4(-2)

        <p>
          It is obviously very difficult to simply look at these equations and discern anything.
          This is done intentionally.
          In the <q>real world,</q> most equations that are used do not have nice,
          integer coefficients.
          Rather, there are lots of digits after the decimal and the equations can look <q>messy.</q>
        </p>

        <p>
          We again start by deciding whether or not each line has the same direction.
          The direction of <m>\ell_1</m> is given by
          <m>\vec d_1 = \la 1.6,2.72,-3.36\ra</m> and the direction of <m>\ell_2</m> is given by <m>\vec d_2 = \la -2.9,-4.93,6.09\ra</m>.
          When it is not clear through observation whether two vectors are parallel or not,
          the standard way of determining this is by comparing their respective unit vectors.
          Using a calculator, we find:
          <md>
            <mrow>\vec u_1 \amp = \frac{\vec d_1}{\norm{\vec d_1}} = \la 0.3471,0.5901,-0.7289\ra</mrow>
            <mrow>\vec u_2 \amp = \frac{\vec d_2}{\norm{\vec d_2}} = \la -0.3471,-0.5901,0.7289\ra</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The two vectors seem to be parallel
          (at least, their components are equal to 4 decimal places).
          In most situations,
          it would suffice to conclude that the lines are at least parallel,
          if not the same.
          One way to be sure is to rewrite <m>\vec d_1</m> and
          <m>\vec d_2</m> in terms of fractions, not decimals.
          We have
          <me>
            \vec d_1 =\la \frac{16}{10},\frac{272}{100},-\frac{336}{100}\ra \qquad \vec d_2 = \la -\frac{29}{10},-\frac{493}{100},\frac{609}{100}\ra
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          One can then find the magnitudes of each vector in terms of fractions,
          then compute the unit vectors likewise.
          After a lot of manual arithmetic
          (or after briefly using a computer algebra system),
          one finds that
          <me>
            \vec u_1 = \la \sqrt{\frac{10}{83}},\frac{17}{\sqrt{830}},-\frac{21}{\sqrt{830}}\ra \qquad \vec u_2 = \la -\sqrt{\frac{10}{83}},-\frac{17}{\sqrt{830}},\frac{21}{\sqrt{830}}\ra
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can now say without equivocation that these lines are parallel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Are they the same line?
          The parametric equations for a line describe one point that lies on the line,
          so we know that the point <m>P_1 = (-0.7,4.2,2.3)</m> lies on <m>\ell_1</m>.
          To determine if this point also lies on <m>\ell_2</m>,
          plug in the <m>x</m>,
          <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> values of <m>P_1</m> into the symmetric equations for <m>\ell_2</m>:
          <me>
            \frac{(-0.7)-2.8}{-2.9} \stackrel{?}{=} \frac{(4.2)-10.15}{-4.93} \stackrel{?}{=} \frac{(2.3)-(-5.05)}{6.09}  \Rightarrow  1.2069=1.2069=1.2069

    <title>Distances</title>
    <p>
      Given a point <m>Q</m> and a line <m>\vec\ell(t) = \vec p+t\vec d</m> in space,
      it is often useful to know the distance from the point to the line.
      (Here we use the standard definition of <q>distance,</q>
      i.e., the length of the shortest line segment from the point to the line.)
      Identifying <m>\vec p</m> with the point <m>P</m>,
      <xref ref="fig_lines_dist1">Figure</xref>
      will help establish a general method of computing this distance <m>h</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_lines_dist1">
      <caption>Establishing the distance from a point to a line.</caption>
      <img src="figures/figlines_dist1"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      From trigonometry, we know <m>h = \norm{\vv{PQ}}\sin\theta</m>.
      We have a similar identity involving the cross product:
      <m>\norm{\vv{PQ}\times \vec d} = \norm{\vv{PQ}}\, \vnorm{d}\sin\theta</m>.
      Divide both sides of this latter equation by <m>\vnorm{d}</m> to obtain <m>h</m>:
      <men xml:id="eq_lines2">
        h = \frac{\norm{\vv{PQ}\times \vec d}}{\vnorm{d}}
      </men>.
    </p>

      <img src="figures/figlines_dist2_3D"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      It is also useful to determine the distance between lines,
      which we define as the length of the shortest line segment that connects the two lines
      (an argument from geometry shows that this line segments is perpendicular to both lines).
      Let lines <m>\vec\ell_1(t) = \vec p_1 + t\vec d_1</m> and <m>\vec\ell_2(t) = \vec p_2 + t\vec d_2</m> be given,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_lines_dist2">Figure</xref>.
      To find the direction orthogonal to both <m>\vec d_1</m> and <m>\vec d_2</m>,
      we take the cross product:
      <m>\vec c = \vec d_1\times \vec d_2</m>.
      The magnitude of the orthogonal projection of
      <m>\vv{P_1P_2}</m> onto <m>\vec c</m> is the distance <m>h</m> we seek:
      <md>
        <mrow>h\amp =    \snorm{\text{ proj } \,_{\vec c}\,\vv{P_1P_2}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \snorm{\frac{\vv{P_1P_2}\cdot\vec c}{\dotp cc}\vec c}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\frac{|\vv{P_1P_2}\cdot \vec c|}{\vnorm c^2}\vnorm c</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\frac{|\vv{P_1P_2}\cdot \vec c|}{\vnorm c}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A problem in the Exercise section is to show that this distance is 0 when the lines intersect.
      Note the use of the Triple Scalar Product:
      <m>\vv{P_1P_2}\cdot c = \vv{P_1P_2}\cdot (\vec d_1\times \vec d_2)</m>.
    </p>

      One of the key points to understand from this section is this:
      to describe a line, we need a point and a direction.
      Whenever a problem is posed concerning a line,
      one needs to take whatever information is offered and glean point and direction information.
      Many questions can be asked
      (and <em>are</em> asked in the Exercise section)
      whose answer immediately follows from this understanding.

    <p>
      Lines are one of two fundamental objects of study in space.
      The other fundamental object is the <em>plane</em>,
      which we study in detail in the next section.
      Many complex three dimensional objects are studied by approximating their surfaces with lines and planes.

      <answer>
        <p>
          (Note: this solution is easier once one has studied <xref ref="sec_planes">Section</xref>.) Since the two lines intersect,
          we can state <m>P_2= P_1 + a\vec d_1+b\vec d_2</m> for some scalars <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
          (Here we abuse notation slightly and add points to vectors.)
          Thus <m>\vv{P_1P_2} = a\vec d_1+b\vec d_2</m>.
          Vector <m>\vec c</m> is the cross product of <m>\vec d_1</m> and <m>\vec d_2</m>,
          hence is orthogonal to both, and hence is orthogonal to <m>\vv{P_1P_2}</m>.
          Thus <m>\vv{P_1P_2}\cdot\vec c = 0</m>,
          and the distance between lines is <m>0</m>.

              The distance formula cannot be used because since
              <m>\vec d_1</m> and <m>\vec d_2</m> are parallel,
              <m>\vec c</m> is <m>\vec 0</m> and we cannot divide by <m>\vnorm{0}</m>.

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>\vec d_1</m> and <m>\vec d_2</m> are parallel,
              <m>\vv{P_1P_2}</m> lies in the plane formed by the two lines.
              Thus <m>\vv{P_1P_2}\times\vec d_2</m> is orthogonal to this plane,
              and <m>\vec c=(\vv{P_1P_2}\times\vec d_2)\times \vec d_2</m> is parallel to the plane,
              but still orthogonal to both <m>\vec d_1</m> and <m>\vec d_2</m>.
              We desire the length of the projection of <m>\vv{P_1P_2}</m> onto <m>\vec c</m>,
              which is what the formula provides.

              Since the lines are parallel,
              one can measure the distance between the lines at any location on either line

              one can use a measuring tape anywhere along the track,
              not just at one specific place.)
              Let <m>P=P_1</m> and <m>Q=P_2</m> as given by the equations of the lines,
              and apply the formula for distance between a point and a line.
