  <title>Conic Sections</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The ancient Greeks recognized that interesting shapes can be formed by intersecting a plane with a
      <em>double napped</em> cone (i.e., two identical cones placed tip<ndash />to<ndash />tip as shown in the following figures).
      As these shapes are formed as sections of conics,
      they have earned the official name <q>conic sections.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      The three <q>most interesting</q>
      conic sections are given in the top row of <xref ref="fig_nondeg_conic">Figure</xref>.
      They are the parabola, the ellipse
      (which includes circles)
      and the hyperbola.
      In each of these cases, the plane does not intersect the tips of the cones
      (usually taken to be the origin).

    <p>
      When the plane does contain the origin,
      three <em>degenerate</em> cones can be formed as shown the bottom row of <xref ref="fig_nondeg_conic">Figure</xref>:
      a point, a line, and crossed lines.
      We focus here on the nondegenerate cases.

    <p>
      While the above geometric constructs define the conics in an intuitive,
      visual way,
      these constructs are not very helpful when trying to analyze the shapes algebraically or consider them as the graph of a function.
      It can be shown that all conics can be defined by the general second<ndash />degree equation
      <me>
        Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this algebraic definition has its uses,
      most find another geometric perspective of the conics more beneficial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each nondegenerate conic can be defined as the <em>locus</em>, or set,
      of points that satisfy a certain distance property.
      These distance properties can be used to generate an algebraic formula,
      allowing us to study each conic as the graph of a function.

          A <term>parabola</term> is the locus of all points equidistant from a point
          (called a <term>focus</term>)
          and a line
          (called the <term>directrix</term>)
          that does not contain the focus.

      <img src="figures/figparabola_def"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      <xref ref="fig_parabola_def">Figure</xref> illustrates this definition.
      The point halfway between the focus and the directrix is the <em>vertex</em>.
      The line through the focus,
      perpendicular to the directrix,
      is the <em>axis of symmetry</em>,
      as the portion of the parabola on one side of this line is the mirror<ndash />image of the portion on the opposite side.
    </p>

    <p>
      The definition leads us to an algebraic formula for the parabola.
      Let <m>P=(x,y)</m> be a point on a parabola whose focus is at <m>F=(0,p)</m> and whose directrix is at <m>y=-p</m>. (We'll assume for now that the focus lies on the <m>y</m>-axis;
      by placing the focus <m>p</m> units above the <m>x</m>-axis and the directrix <m>p</m> units below this axis,
      the vertex will be at <m>(0,0)</m>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      We use the Distance Formula to find the distance <m>d_1</m> between <m>F</m> and <m>P</m>:
      <me>
        d_1=\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-p)^2}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The distance <m>d_2</m> from <m>P</m> to the directrix is more straightforward:
      <me>
        d_2=y-(-p) = y+p
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      These two distances are equal.
      Setting <m>d_1=d_2</m>, we can solve for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>d_1\amp = d_2</mrow>
        <mrow>\sqrt{x^2+(y-p)^2} \amp = y+p</mrow>
        <intertext>Now square both sides.</intertext>
        <mrow>x^2+(y-p)^2 \amp = (y+p)^2</mrow>
        <mrow>x^2+y^2-2yp+p^2 \amp = y^2+2yp+p^2</mrow>

        <mrow>y\amp = \frac{1}{4p}x^2</mrow>

    </p>

    <p>
      The geometric definition of the parabola has led us to the familiar quadratic function whose graph is a parabola with vertex at the origin.
      When we allow the vertex to not be at <m>(0,0)</m>,
      we get the following standard form of the parabola.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We need to put the equation of the parabola in its general form.
          This requires us to complete the square:
          <md>
            <mrow>x \amp = \frac18y^2-y+1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac18\big(y^2-8y+8\big)</mrow>

          Hence the vertex is located at <m>(-1,4)</m>.
          We have <m>\frac18=\frac1{4p}</m>, so <m>p=2</m>.
          We conclude that the focus is located at <m>(1,4)</m> and the directrix is <m>x=-3</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Reflective Property</title>
    <p>
      One of the fascinating things about the nondegenerate conic sections is their reflective properties.
      Parabolas have the following reflective property:
    </p>

    <p>
      Any ray emanating from the focus that intersects the parabola reflects off along a line perpendicular to the directrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is illustrated in <xref ref="fig_conic_reflect">Figure</xref>.
      The following theorem states this more rigorously.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_conic_reflect">
      <caption>Illustrating the parabola's reflective property.</caption>
      <img src="figures/figconic_reflect"/>
    </figure>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_parabola_reflect">
      <title>Reflective Property of the Parabola</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>P</m> be a point on a parabola.
          The tangent line to the parabola at <m>P</m> makes equal angles with the following two lines:

          <ol>
            <li>

              </p>

            <li>

          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      Because of this reflective property,
      paraboloids (the 3D analogue of parabolas) make for useful flashlight reflectors as the light from the bulb,
      ideally located at the focus,
      is reflected along parallel rays.
      Satellite dishes also have paraboloid shapes.
      Signals coming from satellites effectively approach the dish along parallel rays.
      The dish then <em>focuses</em> these rays at the focus,
      where the sensor is located.

        <p>

      An easy way to visualize this construction of an ellipse is to pin both ends of a string to a board.
      The pins become the foci.
      Holding a pencil tight against the string places the pencil on the ellipse;
      the sum of distances from the pencil to the pins is constant:
      the length of the string.
      See <xref ref="fig_ellipse_def">Figure</xref>.

      <img src="figures/figellipse_def"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      We can again find an algebraic equation for an ellipse using this geometric definition.
      Let the foci be located along the <m>x</m>-axis,
      <m>c</m> units from the origin.
      Let these foci be labeled as
      <m>F_1 = (-c,0)</m> and <m>F_2=(c,0)</m>.
      Let <m>P=(x,y)</m> be a point on the ellipse.
      The sum of distances from <m>F_1</m> to <m>P</m> (<m>d_1</m>) and from <m>F_2</m> to <m>P</m> (<m>d_2</m>) is a constant <m>d</m>.
      That is, <m>d_1+d_2=d</m>.
      Using the Distance Formula, we have
      <me>
        \sqrt{(x+c)^2+y^2} + \sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2} = d
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using a fair amount of algebra can produce the following equation of an ellipse (note that the equation is an implicitly defined function;
      it has to be, as an ellipse fails the Vertical Line Test):
      <me>
        \frac{x^2}{\left(\frac d2\right)^2} + \frac{y^2}{\left(\frac d2\right)^2-c^2} = 1
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not particularly illuminating,
      but by making the substitution <m>a=d/2</m> and <m>b=\sqrt{a^2-c^2}</m>,
      we can rewrite the above equation as
      <me>
        \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This choice of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is not without reason;
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_ellipse_label">Figure</xref>,
      the values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have geometric meaning in the graph of the ellipse.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, the two foci of an ellipse lie on the
      <em>major axis</em> of the ellipse,
      and the midpoint of the segment joining the two foci is the <em>center</em>.
      The major axis intersects the ellipse at two points,
      each of which is a <em>vertex</em>.
      The line segment through the center and perpendicular to the major axis is the <em>minor axis</em>.
      The <q>constant sum of distances</q>
      that defines the ellipse is the length of the major axis,
      i.e., <m>2a</m>.

      We do not have a convenient way of visualizing the construction of a hyperbola as we did for the ellipse.
      The geometric definition does allow us to find an algebraic expression that describes it.
      It will be useful to define some terms first.

    <p>
      The two foci lie on the <em>transverse axis</em> of the hyperbola;
      the midpoint of the line segment joining the foci is the
      <em>center</em> of the hyperbola.
      The transverse axis intersects the hyperbola at two points,
      each a <em>vertex</em> of the hyperbola.
      The line through the center and perpendicular to the transverse axis is the
      <em>conjugate axis.</em>
      This is illustrated in <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_def">Figure</xref>.
      It is easy to show that the constant difference of distances used in the definition of the hyperbola is the distance between the vertices,
      i.e., <m>2a</m>.

      <em> Graphing Hyperbolas</em>

    <p>
      Consider the hyperbola <m>\frac{x^2}9-\frac{y^2}1 = 1</m>.
      Solving for <m>y</m>, we find <m>y=\pm\sqrt{x^2/9-1}</m>.
      As <m>x</m> grows large,
      the <q><m>-1</m></q> part of the equation for <m>y</m> becomes less significant and <m>y\approx \pm\sqrt{x^2/9} = \pm x/3</m>.
      That is, as <m>x</m> gets large,
      the graph of the hyperbola looks very much like the lines <m>y=\pm x/3</m>.
      These lines are asymptotes of the hyperbola,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_asy1">Figure</xref>.

      This is a valuable tool in sketching.
      Given the equation of a hyperbola in general form,
      draw a rectangle centered at <m>(h,k)</m> with sides of length <m>2a</m> parallel to the transverse axis and sides of length <m>2b</m> parallel to the conjugate axis.
      (See <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_asy2">Figure</xref>

      The diagonals of the rectangle lie on the asymptotes.

      Hyperbolas share a similar reflective property with ellipses.
      However, in the case of a hyperbola,
      a ray emanating from a focus that intersects the hyperbola reflects along a line containing the other focus,
      but moving <em>away</em> from that focus.
      This is illustrated in <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_reflect">Figure</xref>

      Determining the location of a known event has many practical uses
      (locating the epicenter of an earthquake, an airplane crash site,
      the position of the person speaking in a large room, etc.).
    </p>

    <p>
      To determine the location of an earthquake's epicenter,
      seismologists use <em>trilateration</em>
      (not to be confused with <em>triangulation</em>).
      A seismograph allows one to determine how far away the epicenter was;
      using three separate readings,
      the location of the epicenter can be approximated.

    <p>
      A key to this method is knowing distances.
      What if this information is not available?

      The microphone does not <q>know</q>
      when the sound was <em>created</em>,
      only when the sound was <em>detected</em>.
      How can the location be determined in such a situation?
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_hyperbola_reflect">
      <caption>Illustrating the reflective property of a hyperbola.</caption>
      <img src="figures/fighyperbola_reflect"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      If each location has a clock set to the same time,
      hyperbolas can be used to determine the location.
      Suppose the microphone at position <m>A</m> records the sound at exactly 12:00,
      location <m>B</m> records the time exactly 1 second later,
      and location <m>C</m> records the noise exactly 2 seconds after that.
      We are interested in the <em>difference</em> of times.
      Since the speed of sound is approximately 340 m/s, we can conclude quickly that the sound was created 340 meters closer to position <m>A</m> than position <m>B</m>.
      If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are a known distance apart (as shown in <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_locate">Figure</xref> (a)),
      then we can determine a hyperbola on which <m>D</m> must lie.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <q>difference of distances</q> is 340;
      this is also the distance between vertices of the hyperbola.
      So we know <m>2a= 340</m>.
      Positions <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> lie on the foci, so <m>2c=1000</m>.
      From this we can find <m>b\approx 470</m> and can sketch the hyperbola,
      given in part (b) of the figure.
      We only care about the side closest to <m>A</m>. (Why?)
    </p>

    <p>
      We can also find the hyperbola defined by positions <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>.
      In this case,
      <m>2a = 680</m> as the sound traveled an extra 2 seconds to get to <m>C</m>.
      We still have <m>2c=1000</m>,
      centering this hyperbola at <m>(-500,500)</m>.
      We find <m>b\approx 367</m>.
      This hyperbola is sketched in part (c) of the figure.
      The intersection point of the two graphs is the location of the sound,
      at approximately <m>(188,-222.5)</m>.

      This chapter explores curves in the plane,
      in particular curves that cannot be described by functions of the form <m>y=f(x)</m>.
      In this section,
      we learned of ellipses and hyperbolas that are defined implicitly,
      not explicitly.
      In the following sections,
      we will learn completely new ways of describing curves in the plane,
      using <em>parametric equations</em>
      and <em>polar coordinates</em>,
      then study these curves using calculus techniques.

        <p>
          What is the difference between degenerate and nondegenerate conics?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          When defining the conics as the intersections of a plane and a double napped cone,
          degenerate conics are created when the plane intersects the tips of the cones
          (usually taken as the origin).
          Nondegenerate conics are formed when this plane does not contain the origin.

          Explain why the following is true:
          <q>If the coefficient of the <m>x^2</m> term in the equation of an ellipse in standard form is smaller than the coefficient of the <m>y^2</m> term,
          then the ellipse has a horizontal major axis.</q>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          With the equation <m>\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=1</m>,
          the ellipse has a horizontal major axis if <m>a>b</m>.
          But the coefficient of the <m>x^2</m> term is <m>1/a^2</m>
          (not <m>a^2</m>),
          so if <m>1/a^2\lt 1/b^2</m>, then <m>a>b</m> and the major axis is horizontal.

          Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets of our solar system have elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.
          The Earth's elliptical orbit is used as a standard unit of distance;
          the distance from the center of Earth's elliptical orbit to one vertex is 1 Astronomical Unit, or A.U.
