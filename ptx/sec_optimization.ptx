  <p>
    In <xref ref="sec_extreme_values">Section</xref>
    we learned about extreme values <mdash/> the largest and smallest values a
    function attains on an interval.
    We motivated our interest in such values by discussing how it made sense to
    want to know the highest/lowest values of a stock,
    or the fastest/slowest an object was moving.
    In this section we apply the concepts of extreme values to solve
    <q>word problems,</q>
    i.e., problems stated in terms of situations that require us to create the
    appropriate mathematical framework in which to solve the problem.
        <idx><h>optimization</h></idx>
  </p>

  <p>
    We start with a classic example which is followed by a discussion of the
    topic of optimization.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex_opt1">
    <title>Optimization: perimeter and area</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A man has <m>100</m> feet of fencing,
        a large yard, and a small dog.
        He wants to create a rectangular enclosure for his dog with the fencing
        that provides the maximal area.
        What dimensions provide the maximal area?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        One can likely guess the correct answer <mdash/> that is great.
        We will proceed to show how calculus can provide this answer in a context
        that proves this answer is correct.
      </p>

      <p>
        It helps to make a sketch of the situation.
        Our enclosure is sketched twice in <xref ref="fig_opt1b">Figure</xref>,
        either with green grass and nice fence boards or as a simple rectangle.
        Either way, drawing a rectangle forces us to realize that we need to
        know the dimensions of this rectangle so we can create an area function
        <mdash/> after all,
        we are trying to maximize the area.

      <p>
        We let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> denote the lengths of the sides of the
        rectangle. Clearly,
        <me>
          \text{ Area } =xy
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not yet know how to handle functions with two variables;
        we need to reduce this down to a single variable.
        We know more about the situation:
        the man has <m>100</m> feet of fencing.
        By knowing the perimeter of the rectangle must be <m>100</m>,
        we can create another equation:
        <me>
          \text{ Perimeter }  = 100 = 2x+2y
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We now have two equations and two unknowns.
        In the latter equation, we solve for <m>y</m>:
        <me>
          y = 50-x
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now substitute this expression for <m>y</m> in the area equation:
        <me>
          \text{ Area }  = A(x) = x(50-x)
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note we now have an equation of one variable;
        we can truly call the Area a function of <m>x</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This function only makes sense when <m>0\leq x \leq 50</m>,
        otherwise we get negative values of area.
        So we find the extreme values of <m>A(x)</m> on the interval
        <m>[0,50]</m> using <xref ref="idea_extrema">Key Idea</xref>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To find the critical points,
        we take the derivative of <m>A(x)</m> and set it equal to <m>0</m>,
        then solve for <m>x</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>A(x) \amp = x(50-x)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 50x-x^2</mrow>
          <mrow>A'(x)   \amp = 50-2x</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        We solve <m>50-2x=0</m> to find <m>x=25</m>;
        this is the only critical point.
        We evaluate <m>A(x)</m> at the endpoints of our interval and at this
        critical point to find the extreme values;
        in this case, all we care about is the maximum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clearly <m>A(0)=0</m> and <m>A(50)=0</m>,
        whereas <m>A(25) = 625</m><quantity>
          <unit base="foot" exp="2"/>
        </quantity>.
        This is the maximum.
        Since we earlier found <m>y = 50-x</m>,
        we find that <m>y</m> is also <m>25</m>.
        Thus the dimensions of the rectangular enclosure with perimeter of
        <quantity>
          <mag>100</mag><unit base="foot"/>
        </quantity>. with maximum area is a square, with sides of length
        <quantity>
          <mag>25</mag><unit base="foot"/>
        </quantity>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    This example is very simplistic and a bit contrived.
    (After all, most people create a design then buy fencing to meet their needs,
    and not buy fencing and plan later.)
    But it models well the necessary process:
    create equations that describe a situation,
    reduce an equation to a single variable,
    then find the needed extreme value.
  </p>

  <p>
    <q>In real life,</q> problems are much more complex.
    The equations are often <em>not</em>
    reducible to a single variable
    (hence multi-variable calculus is needed)
    and the equations themselves may be difficult to form.
    Understanding the principles here will provide a good foundation for the
    mathematics you will likely encounter later.
  </p>

  <p>
    We outline here the basic process of solving these optimization problems.

        Here is another classic calculus problem: A woman has a 100 feet of
        fencing, a small dog, and a large yard that contains a stream
        (that is mostly straight).
        She wants to create a rectangular enclosure with maximal area that uses
        the stream as one side.

          <li>
            <p>
              We want to maximize the area;
              as in the example before,
              <me>
                \text{ Area }  = xy
              </me>.
              This is our fundamental equation.
              This defines area as a function of two variables,
              so we need another equation to  reduce it to one variable.
            </p>

            <p>
              We again appeal to the perimeter;
              here the perimeter is
              <me>
                \text{ Perimeter }  = 100 = x+2y
              </me>.
              The perimeter is our constraint equation.
              Note how this is a different equation for perimeter than in
              <xref ref="ex_opt1">Example</xref>,
              since one of the sides does not need to be fenced.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We now reduce the fundamental equation to a single variable using
              our constraint equation.
              In the perimeter equation, solve for <m>y</m>: <m>y = 50 - x/2</m>.
              We can now write Area as
              <md>
                <mrow>\text{ Area }  = A(x) \amp= x(50-x/2)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = 50x - \frac12x^2</mrow>
              </md>.
              Area is now defined as a function of one variable.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We want the area to be non-negative.
              Since <m>A(x) = x(50-x/2)</m>,
              we want <m>x\geq 0</m> and <m>50-x/2\geq 0</m>.
              The latter inequality implies that <m>x\leq100</m>,
              so <m>0\leq x\leq 100</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We now find the extreme values.
              At the endpoints, the minimum is found,
              giving an area of <m>0</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Find the critical points.
              We have <m>A'(x) = 50-x</m>;
              setting this equal to 0 and solving for <m>x</m> returns <m>x=50</m>.
              This gives an area of
              <me>
                A(50) = 50(25) = 1250
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We earlier set <m>y = 50-x/2</m>; thus <m>y = 25</m>.

    Keep in mind as we do these problems that we are practicing a <em>process</em>;
    that is, we are learning to turn a situation into a system of equations.
    These equations allow us to write a certain quantity as a function of one
    variable, which we then optimize.

        A power line needs to be run from a power station located on the beach

        We will follow the strategy of
        <xref ref="idea_optimization">Key Idea</xref> implicitly,
        without specifically numbering steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two immediate solutions that we could consider,
        each of which we will reject through
        <q>common sense.</q> First,
        we could minimize the distance by directly connecting the two
        locations with a straight line.
        However, this requires that all the wire be laid underwater,
        the most costly option.
        Second, we could minimize the underwater length by running a wire all
        <quantity>
          <mag>5000</mag><unit base="foot"/>
        </quantity>
        along the beach, directly across from the offshore facility.
        This has the undesired effect of having the longest distance of all,
        probably ensuring a non-minimal cost.
      </p>

      <p>
        The optimal solution likely has the line being run along the ground for
        a while, then underwater, as the figure implies.
        We need to label our unknown distances <mdash/> the distance run along
        the ground and the distance run underwater.
        Recognizing that the underwater distance can be measured as the
        hypotenuse of a right triangle,
        we choose to label the distances as shown in
        <xref ref="fig_opt3c">Figure</xref>.

      <p>
        By choosing <m>x</m> as we did
        (instead of letting <m>x</m> be the distance along the land),
        we make the expression under the square root simple.
        We now create the cost function.
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow>\text{Cost} \amp ={}\amp\amp \text{land cost}              \amp\amp +\text{water cost}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp\amp\amp   \$50\times \text{land distance} \amp\amp +\$130 \times \text{water distance}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp\amp\amp   50(5000-x)                      \amp\amp +130\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we have <m>c(x) = 50(5000-x)+ 130\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}</m>.
        This function only makes sense on the interval <m>[0,5000]</m>.
        While we are fairly certain the endpoints will not give a minimal cost,
        we still evaluate <m>c(x)</m> at each to verify.
        <md>
          <mrow>c(0) \amp = 380{,}000\amp c(5000) \amp \approx 662{,}873</mrow>
        </md>.
        (Notice that if <m>x=0</m>, the line is run the full
        <quantity>
          <mag>5000</mag><unit base="foot"/>
        </quantity>
        along land and a full
        <quantity>
          <mag>1000</mag><unit base="foot"/>
        </quantity>
        under water.
        If <m>x=5000</m>, the line is run the maximum distance underwater.)
      </p>

      <p>
        We now find the critical values of <m>c(x)</m>.
        We compute <m>c'(x)</m> as
        <me>
          c'(x) = -50+\frac{130x}{\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}}
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recognize that this is never undefined.
        Setting <m>c'(x)=0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>, we have:
        <md>
          <mrow>-50+\frac{130x}{\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}} \amp = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{130x}{\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}}  \amp = 50</mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{130^2x^2}{x^2+1000^2} \amp = 50^2</mrow>
          <mrow>130^2x^2 \amp = 50^2(x^2+1000^2)</mrow>
          <mrow>130^2x^2-50^2x^2 \amp = 50^2\cdot1000^2</mrow>
          <mrow>(130^2-50^2)x^2 \amp = 50,000^2</mrow>
          <mrow>x^2 \amp = \frac{50,000^2}{130^2-50^2}</mrow>
          <mrow>x \amp = \frac{50,000}{\sqrt{130^2-50^2}}</mrow>
          <mrow>x \amp  = \frac{50,000}{120} =\frac{1250}3\approx 416.67</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Evaluating <m>c(x)</m> at <m>x=416.67</m> gives a minimal cost of about
        <m>\$370{,}000</m>.
        The distance the power line is laid along land is
        <m>5000-416.67 = 4583.33</m> ft., and the underwater distance is
        <m>\sqrt{416.67^2+1000^2} \approx 1083</m> ft.

    In the exercises you will see a variety of situations that require you to
    combine problem-solving skills with calculus.
    Focus on the <em>process</em>;
    learn how to form equations from situations that can be manipulated into
    what you need.
    Eschew memorizing how to do <q>this kind of problem</q>
    as opposed to <q>that kind of problem.</q>
    Learning a process will benefit one far longer than memorizing a specific
    technique.
