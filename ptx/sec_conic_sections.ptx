  <introduction>
    <p>
      The ancient Greeks recognized that interesting shapes can be formed by intersecting a plane with a
      <em>double napped</em> cone (<ie/>, two identical cones placed tip-to-tip as shown in the following figures).
      As these shapes are formed as sections of conics,
      they have earned the official name <q>conic sections.</q>

    <p>
      The three <q>most interesting</q>
      conic sections are given in the top row of <xref ref="fig_nondeg_conic"/>.
      They are the parabola, the ellipse
      (which includes circles)
      and the hyperbola.
      In each of these cases, the plane does not intersect the tips of the cones
      (usually taken to be the origin).

      When the plane does contain the origin,
      three <em>degenerate</em> cones can be formed as shown the bottom row of <xref ref="fig_nondeg_conic"/>:
      a point, a line, and crossed lines.
      We focus here on the nondegenerate cases.

    <p>
      While the above geometric constructs define the conics in an intuitive,
      visual way,
      these constructs are not very helpful when trying to analyze the shapes algebraically or consider them as the graph of a function.
      It can be shown that all conics can be defined by the general second-degree equation
      <me>
        Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this algebraic definition has its uses,
      most find another geometric perspective of the conics more beneficial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each nondegenerate conic can be defined as the <em>locus</em>, or set,
      of points that satisfy a certain distance property.
      These distance properties can be used to generate an algebraic formula,
      allowing us to study each conic as the graph of a function.

    <p>
      <xref ref="fig_parabola_def"/> illustrates this definition.
      The point halfway between the focus and the directrix is the <em>vertex</em>.
      The line through the focus,
      perpendicular to the directrix,
      is the <em>axis of symmetry</em>,
      as the portion of the parabola on one side of this line is the mirror-image of the portion on the opposite side.
    </p>

    <p>
      The definition leads us to an algebraic formula for the parabola.
      Let <m>P=(x,y)</m> be a point on a parabola whose focus is at <m>F=(0,p)</m> and whose directrix is at <m>y=-p</m>. (We'll assume for now that the focus lies on the <m>y</m>-axis;
      by placing the focus <m>p</m> units above the <m>x</m>-axis and the directrix <m>p</m> units below this axis,
      the vertex will be at <m>(0,0)</m>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      We use the Distance Formula to find the distance <m>d_1</m> between <m>F</m> and <m>P</m>:
      <me>
        d_1=\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-p)^2}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The distance <m>d_2</m> from <m>P</m> to the directrix is more straightforward:
      <me>
        d_2=y-(-p) = y+p
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      These two distances are equal.
      Setting <m>d_1=d_2</m>, we can solve for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>d_1\amp = d_2</mrow>
        <mrow>\sqrt{x^2+(y-p)^2} \amp = y+p</mrow>
        <intertext>Now square both sides.</intertext>
        <mrow>x^2+(y-p)^2 \amp = (y+p)^2</mrow>
        <mrow>x^2+y^2-2yp+p^2 \amp = y^2+2yp+p^2</mrow>

      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The geometric definition of the parabola has led us to the familiar quadratic function whose graph is a parabola with vertex at the origin.
      When we allow the vertex to not be at <m>(0,0)</m>,
      we get the following standard form of the parabola.

      <solution>
        <p>
          We need to put the equation of the parabola in its general form.
          This requires us to complete the square:
          <md>
            <mrow>x \amp = \frac18y^2-y+1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac18\big(y^2-8y+8\big)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =  \frac18\big(y^2-8y+16 -16+8\big)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =  \frac18\big((y-4)^2 - 8\big)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =  \frac18(y-4)^2 -1</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hence the vertex is located at <m>(-1,4)</m>.
          We have <m>\frac18=\frac1{4p}</m>, so <m>p=2</m>.
          We conclude that the focus is located at <m>(1,4)</m> and the directrix is <m>x=-3</m>.
          The parabola is graphed in <xref ref="fig_conic2"/>,

      <title>Reflective Property</title>
      <p>
        One of the fascinating things about the nondegenerate conic sections is their reflective properties.
        Parabolas have the following reflective property:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
        	Any ray emanating from the focus that intersects the parabola reflects off along a line perpendicular to the directrix.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      	This is illustrated in <xref ref="fig_conic_reflect"/>. The following theorem states this more rigorously.

        Because of this reflective property,
        paraboloids (the 3D analogue of parabolas) make for useful flashlight reflectors as the light from the bulb,
        ideally located at the focus,
        is reflected along parallel rays.
        Satellite dishes also have paraboloid shapes.
        Signals coming from satellites effectively approach the dish along parallel rays.
        The dish then <em>focuses</em> these rays at the focus,
        where the sensor is located.

      An easy way to visualize this construction of an ellipse is to pin both ends of a string to a board.
      The pins become the foci.
      Holding a pencil tight against the string places the pencil on the ellipse;
      the sum of distances from the pencil to the pins is constant:
      the length of the string.

            Two points are drawn, around which an ellipse is sketched.
            A pencil is drawn, representing the sketching of the ellipse.
            The point of the pencil is touching the ellipse in the top right of the ellipse.

      We can again find an algebraic equation for an ellipse using this geometric definition.
      Let the foci be located along the <m>x</m>-axis,
      <m>c</m> units from the origin.
      Let these foci be labeled as
      <m>F_1 = (-c,0)</m> and <m>F_2=(c,0)</m>.
      Let <m>P=(x,y)</m> be a point on the ellipse.
      The sum of distances from <m>F_1</m> to <m>P</m> (<m>d_1</m>) and from <m>F_2</m> to <m>P</m> (<m>d_2</m>) is a constant <m>d</m>.
      That is, <m>d_1+d_2=d</m>.
      Using the Distance Formula, we have
      <me>
        \sqrt{(x+c)^2+y^2} + \sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2} = d
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using a fair amount of algebra can produce the following equation of an ellipse (note that the equation is an implicitly defined function;
      it has to be, as an ellipse fails the Vertical Line Test):
      <me>
        \frac{x^2}{\left(\frac d2\right)^2} + \frac{y^2}{\left(\frac d2\right)^2-c^2} = 1
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not particularly illuminating,
      but by making the substitution <m>a=d/2</m> and <m>b=\sqrt{a^2-c^2}</m>,
      we can rewrite the above equation as
      <me>
        \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This choice of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is not without reason;
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_ellipse_label"/>,
      the values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have geometric meaning in the graph of the ellipse.

      In general, the two foci of an ellipse lie on the
      <em>major axis</em> of the ellipse,
      and the midpoint of the segment joining the two foci is the <em>center</em>.
      The major axis intersects the ellipse at two points,
      each of which is a <em>vertex</em>.
      The line segment through the center and perpendicular to the major axis is the <em>minor axis</em>.
      The <q>constant sum of distances</q>

          Graph the ellipse defined by <m>4x^2+9y^2-8x-36y=-4</m>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          It is simple to graph an ellipse once it is in standard form.
          In order to put the given equation in standard form,
          we must complete the square with both the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> terms.
          We first rewrite the equation by regrouping:
          <me>
            4x^2+9y^2-8x-36y=-4  \Rightarrow  (4x^2-8x) + (9y^2-36y) = -4
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we complete the squares.
          <md>
            <mrow>(4x^2-8x) + (9y^2-36y) \amp = -4</mrow>
            <mrow>4(x^2-2x) + 9(y^2-4y) \amp = -4</mrow>
            <mrow>4(x^2-2x +1 - 1) + 9(y^2-4y+4-4) \amp = - 4</mrow>
            <mrow>4\big((x-1)^2-1\big) + 9\big((y-2)^2-4\big) \amp = -4</mrow>
            <mrow>4(x-1)^2 -4 + 9(y-2)^2-36 \amp = -4</mrow>
            <mrow>4(x-1)^2 + 9(y-2)^2 \amp = 36</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{(x-1)^2}{9} + \frac{(y-2)^2}{4} \amp = 1</mrow>

        <p>
          We see the center of the ellipse is at <m>(1,2)</m>.
          We have <m>a=3</m> and <m>b=2</m>;
          the major axis is horizontal,
          so the vertices are located at <m>(-2,2)</m> and <m>(4,2)</m>.
          We find <m>c=\sqrt{9-4} = \sqrt{5}\approx 2.24</m>.
          The foci are located along the major axis,
          approximately <m>2.24</m> units from the center, at <m>(1\pm 2.24,2)</m>.
          This is all graphed in <xref ref="fig_conic4"/>

        When <m>a=b</m>, we have a circle.
        The general equation becomes
        <me>
          \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} = 1  \Rightarrow (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = a^2

        Since <m>a=b</m>, <m>c = \sqrt{a^2-b^2}=0</m>.
        The circle has <q>two</q> foci,

        Consider <xref ref="fig_ellipse_ecc"/>,
        where several ellipses are graphed with <m>a=1</m>.
        In <xref ref="fig_ellipse_ecca"/>, we have <m>c=0</m> and the ellipse is a circle.
        As <m>c</m> grows,
        the resulting ellipses look less and less circular.
        A measure of this <q>noncircularness</q>

      The definition of a hyperbola is very similar to the definition of an ellipse;
      we essentially just change the word
      <q>sum</q> to <q>difference.</q>
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def_hyperbola">
      <title>Hyperbola</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>hyperbola</term> is the locus of all points where the absolute value of difference of distances from two fixed points,
          each a focus of the hyperbola, is constant.

    </definition>

    <p>
      We do not have a convenient way of visualizing the construction of a hyperbola as we did for the ellipse.
      The geometric definition does allow us to find an algebraic expression that describes it.
      It will be useful to define some terms first.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two foci lie on the <em>transverse axis</em> of the hyperbola;
      the midpoint of the line segment joining the foci is the
      <em>center</em> of the hyperbola.
      The transverse axis intersects the hyperbola at two points,
      each a <em>vertex</em> of the hyperbola.
      The line through the center and perpendicular to the transverse axis is the
      <em>conjugate axis.</em>
      This is illustrated in <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_def"/>.
      It is easy to show that the constant difference of distances used in the definition of the hyperbola is the distance between the vertices,
      <ie/>, <m>2a</m>.

        <description>
          <p>
            A hyperbola with labels for key components.
            The hyperbola is composed of two seperate segments with a space between them.
            The first shape is on the left. The shape begins in the upper left, moving almost linearly towards the lower right.
            The curve then begins to bend gently backwards before moving linearly towards the bottom left.
            The right curve is a reflection of the left curve. It opens towards the right.
            The entire hyperbola is separated into 4 equal segments by two axes.
            The axis dividing the hyperola in half vertically is labeled as the "conjugate axis."
            The axis dividing th ehyperbola in half horizontally is labeled as the "transverse axis."
            The point in which the axes touch is the center of the hyperbola.
            The points in which the curves intersect the transverse axis are labeled as foci.
            Two foci lie on the transverse axis.
            The first focus is to the left of the left curve.
            The right focus is to the right of the right curve.
            The distance between the left vertex and the center is labeled as <m>a</m>.
            The distance between the center and the right focus is labeled as <m>c</m>.

      <title> Graphing Hyperbolas</title>
      <p>
        Consider the hyperbola <m>\frac{x^2}9-\frac{y^2}1 = 1</m>.
        Solving for <m>y</m>, we find <m>y=\pm\sqrt{x^2/9-1}</m>.
        As <m>x</m> grows large,
        the <q><m>-1</m></q> part of the equation for <m>y</m> becomes less significant and <m>y\approx \pm\sqrt{x^2/9} = \pm x/3</m>.
        That is, as <m>x</m> gets large,
        the graph of the hyperbola looks very much like the lines <m>y=\pm x/3</m>.
        These lines are asymptotes of the hyperbola,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_asy1"/>.

        This is a valuable tool in sketching.
        Given the equation of a hyperbola in general form,
        draw a rectangle centered at <m>(h,k)</m> with sides of length <m>2a</m> parallel to the transverse axis and sides of length <m>2b</m> parallel to the conjugate axis.
        (See <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_asy2"/>
        for an example with a horizontal transverse axis.)
        The diagonals of the rectangle lie on the asymptotes.

        Note that this is the definition of eccentricity as used for the ellipse.
        When <m>c</m> is close in value to <m>a</m> (<ie/>, <m>e\approx 1</m>),
        the hyperbola is very narrow
        (looking almost like crossed lines).
        <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_ecc"/>

        The graph in <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_ecca"/> has <m>c=1.05</m>,
        giving an eccentricity of <m>e=1.05</m>, which is close to 1.
        As <m>c</m> grows larger,
        the hyperbola widens and begins to look like parallel lines,

      <title>Reflective Property</title>
      <p>
        Hyperbolas share a similar reflective property with ellipses.
        However, in the case of a hyperbola,
        a ray emanating from a focus that intersects the hyperbola reflects along a line containing the other focus,
        but moving <em>away</em> from that focus.
        This is illustrated in <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_reflect"/>
        (on the next page).
        Hyperbolic mirrors are commonly used in telescopes because of this reflective property.
        It is stated formally in the following theorem.

      <title>Location Determination</title>
      <p>
        Determining the location of a known event has many practical uses
        (locating the epicenter of an earthquake, an airplane crash site,
        the position of the person speaking in a large room, etc.).
      </p>

      <p>
        To determine the location of an earthquake's epicenter,
        seismologists use <em>trilateration</em>
        (not to be confused with <em>triangulation</em>).
        A seismograph allows one to determine how far away the epicenter was;
        using three separate readings,
        the location of the epicenter can be approximated.
      </p>

      <p>
        A key to this method is knowing distances.
        What if this information is not available?
        Consider three microphones at positions <m>A</m>,
        <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> which all record a noise (a person's voice,
        an explosion, etc.) created at unknown location <m>D</m>.
        The microphone does not <q>know</q>
        when the sound was <em>created</em>,
        only when the sound was <em>detected</em>.
        How can the location be determined in such a situation?

      <p>
        If each location has a clock set to the same time,
        hyperbolas can be used to determine the location.
        Suppose the microphone at position <m>A</m> records the sound at exactly 12:00,
        location <m>B</m> records the time exactly 1 second later,
        and location <m>C</m> records the noise exactly 2 seconds after that.
        We are interested in the <em>difference</em> of times.
        Since the speed of sound is approximately 340 m/s, we can conclude quickly that the sound was created 340 meters closer to position <m>A</m> than position <m>B</m>.
        If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are a known distance apart (as shown in <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_locatea"/>),
        then we can determine a hyperbola on which <m>D</m> must lie.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <q>difference of distances</q> is 340;
        this is also the distance between vertices of the hyperbola.
        So we know <m>2a= 340</m>.
        Positions <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> lie on the foci, so <m>2c=1000</m>.
        From this we can find <m>b\approx 470</m> and can sketch the hyperbola,
        given in <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_locateb"/>.
        We only care about the side closest to <m>A</m>. (Why?)
      </p>

      <p>
        We can also find the hyperbola defined by positions <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>.
        In this case,
        <m>2a = 680</m> as the sound traveled an extra 2 seconds to get to <m>C</m>.
        We still have <m>2c=1000</m>,
        centering this hyperbola at <m>(-500,500)</m>.
        We find <m>b\approx 367</m>.
        This hyperbola is sketched in <xref ref="fig_hyperbola_locatec"/>.
        The intersection point of the two graphs is the location of the sound,
        at approximately <m>(188,-222.5)</m>.

      This chapter explores curves in the plane,
      in particular curves that cannot be described by functions of the form <m>y=f(x)</m>.
      In this section,
      we learned of ellipses and hyperbolas that are defined implicitly,
      not explicitly.
      In the following sections,
      we will learn completely new ways of describing curves in the plane,
      using <em>parametric equations</em>
      and <em>polar coordinates</em>,
      then study these curves using calculus techniques.

                When defining the conics as the intersections of a plane and a double napped cone,
                degenerate conics are created when the plane intersects the tips of the cones
                (usually taken as the origin).
                Nondegenerate conics are formed when this plane does not contain the origin.

                Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets of our solar system have elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.
                The Earth's elliptical orbit is used as a standard unit of distance;
                the distance from the center of Earth's elliptical orbit to one vertex is 1 Astronomical Unit, or A.U.
              </p>

              <p>
                The following table gives information about the orbits of three planets.
