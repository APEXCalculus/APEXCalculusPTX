  <title>Center of Mass</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have used iterated integrals to find areas of plane regions and signed volumes under surfaces.
      A brief recap of these uses will be useful in this section as we apply iterated integrals to compute the <em>mass</em>
      and <em>center of mass</em> of planar regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      To find the area of a planar region,
      we evaluated the double integral <m>\iint_R\, dA</m>.
      That is, summing up the areas of lots of little subregions of <m>R</m> gave us the total area.
      Informally, we think of <m>\iint_R\, dA</m> as meaning
      <q>sum up lots of little areas over <m>R</m>.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      To find the signed volume under a surface,
      we evaluated the double integral <m>\iint_R f(x,y)\, dA</m>.
      Recall that the <q><m>dA</m></q>
      is not just a <q>bookend</q>
      at the end of an integral;
      rather, it is multiplied by <m>f(x,y)</m>.
      We regard <m>f(x,y)</m> as giving a height,
      and <m>dA</m> still giving an area:
      <m>f(x,y)\, dA</m> gives a volume.
      Thus, informally, <m>\iint_Rf(x,y)\, dA</m> means
      <q>sum up lots of little volumes over <m>R</m>.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      We now extend these ideas to other contexts.

    <title>Mass and Weight</title>
    <p>
      Consider a thin sheet of material with constant thickness and finite area.
      Mathematicians
      (and physicists and engineers)
      call such a sheet a <em>lamina</em>.
      So consider a lamina,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_mass_introa"/>,
      with the shape of some planar region <m>R</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig_mass_introb"/>.

                An illustration of a <q>lamina</q> as a region in the plane.
                This particular region has a curved top, like a downward-opening parabola,
                and two sides given by vertical lines.
                The right side is shorter than the left side,
                and the bottom is a line segment with positive slope.

    <p>
      We can write a simple double integral that represents the mass of the lamina:
      <m>\iint_R\, dm</m>, where <q><m>dm</m></q>
      means <q>a little mass.</q> That is,
      the double integral states the total mass of the lamina can be found by
      <q>summing up lots of little masses over <m>R</m>.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      To evaluate this double integral,
      partition <m>R</m> into <m>n</m> subregions as we have done in the past.
      The <m>i</m>th subregion has area <m>\Delta A_i</m>.
      A fundamental property of mass is that
      <q>mass=density<times/>area.</q>
      If the lamina has a constant density <m>\delta</m>,
      then the mass of this <m>i</m>th subregion is <m>\Delta m_i=\delta\Delta A_i</m>.
      That is, we can compute a small amount of mass by multiplying a small amount of area by the density.
    </p>

    <p>
      If density is variable, with density function <m>\delta= \delta(x,y)</m>,
      then we can approximate the mass of the
      <m>i</m>th subregion of <m>R</m> by multiplying
      <m>\Delta A_i</m> by <m>\delta(x_i,y_i)</m>,
      where <m>(x_i,y_i)</m> is a point in that subregion.
      That is, for a small enough subregion of <m>R</m>,
      the density across that region is almost constant.

      <p>
        <em>Mass</em> and <em>weight</em> are different measures.
        Since they are scalar multiples of each other,
        it is often easy to treat them as the same measure.
        In this section we effectively treat them as the same,
        as our technique for finding mass is the same as for finding weight.
        The density functions used will simply have different units.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      The total mass <m>M</m> of the lamina is approximately the sum of approximate masses of subregions:
      <me>
        M \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta m_i = \sum_{i=1}^n \delta(x_i,y_i)\Delta A_i
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking the limit as the size of the subregions shrinks to 0 gives us the actual mass;
      that is, integrating <m>\delta(x,y)</m> over <m>R</m> gives the mass of the lamina.

          The variable density <m>\delta</m>,

          We'll comment on the significance of this momentarily.

          The mass <m>M</m> is found by integrating <m>\delta(x,y)</m> over <m>R</m>.
          The order of integration is not important;
          we choose <m>dx\, dy</m> arbitrarily.
          Thus:

          <m>\delta(x,y) = (2\sqrt{x^2+y^2}+1)\,\text{lb/ft}^2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          A direct application of <xref ref="def_mass"/>
          states that the weight of the lamina is <m>\iint_R\delta(x,y)\, dA</m>.
          Since our lamina is in the shape of a circle,
          it makes sense to approach the double integral using polar coordinates.
        </p>

        <p>
          The density function <m>\delta(x,y) = x^2+y^2+1</m> becomes
          <me>
            \delta(r,\theta) = (r\cos(\theta) )^2+(r\sin(\theta) )^2+1 = r^2+1
          </me>.
          The circle is bounded by <m>0\leq r\leq 2</m> and <m>0\leq\theta\leq2\pi</m>.
          Thus the weight <m>W</m> is:
          <md>
            <mrow>W \amp = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^2 (r^2+1)r\, dr\, d\theta</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^{2\pi} \left.\left(\frac14r^4+\frac12r^2\right)\right|_0^2d\theta</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^{2\pi} \left(6\right) d\theta</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 12\pi \approx 37.70\text{ lb } </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now compare this with the density function <m>\delta(x,y) = 2\sqrt{x^2+y^2}+1</m>.
          Converting this to polar coordinates gives
          <me>
            \delta(r,\theta) = 2\sqrt{(r\cos(\theta) )^2+(r\sin(\theta) )^2}+1 = 2r+1
          </me>.
          Thus the weight <m>W</m> is:
          <md>
            <mrow>W \amp = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^2 (2r+1)r\, dr\, d\theta</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^{2\pi} (\frac23r^3+\frac12r^2)\Big|_0^2d\theta</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^{2\pi} \left(\frac{22}3\right)\, d\theta</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{44}3\pi \approx 46.08\text{ lb } </mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          One would expect different density functions to return different weights,
          as we have here.
          The density functions were chosen, though, to be similar:
          each gives a density of 1 at the origin and a density of 5 at the outside edge of the circle,
          as seen in <xref ref="fig_mass3"/>.

          Notice how <m>x^2+y^2+1 \leq 2\sqrt{x^2+y^2}+1</m> over the circle;

    <p>
      Plotting the density functions can be useful as our understanding of mass can be related to our understanding of
      <q>volume under a surface.</q>
      We interpreted <m>\iint_R f(x,y)\, dA</m> as giving the volume under <m>f</m> over <m>R</m>;
      we can understand <m>\iint_R\delta(x,y)\, dA</m> in the same way.
      The <q>volume</q> under <m>\delta</m> over <m>R</m> is actually mass;
      by compressing the <q>volume</q>
      under <m>\delta</m> onto the <m>xy</m>-plane,
      we get <q>more mass</q> in some areas than others <mdash/> <ie/>, areas of greater density.
    </p>

    <p>
      Knowing the mass of a lamina is one of several important measures.
      Another is the <em>center of mass</em>, which we discuss next.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection>
    <title>Center of Mass</title>
    <p>
      Consider a disk of radius 1 with uniform density.
      It is common knowledge that the disk will balance on a point if the point is placed at the center of the disk.
      What if the disk does not have a uniform density?
      Through trial-and-error,
      we should still be able to find a spot on the disk at which the disk will balance on a point.
      This balance point is referred to as the
      <em>center of mass</em>,
      or <em>center of gravity</em>.
      It is though all the mass is <q>centered</q> there.
      In fact, if the disk has a mass of <quantity><mag>3</mag><unit prefix="kilo" base="gram"/></quantity>,
      the disk will behave physically as though it were a point-mass of
      <quantity><mag>3</mag><unit prefix="kilo" base="gram"/></quantity> located at its center of mass.
      For instance,
      the disk will naturally spin with an axis through its center of mass
      (which is why it is important to
      <q>balance</q> the tires of your car:
      if they are <q>out of balance</q>,
      their center of mass will be outside of the axle and it will shake terribly).
          <idx><h>center of mass</h></idx>
          <idx><h>mass</h><h>center of</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p>
      We find the center of mass based on the principle of a
      <em>weighted average</em>.
      Consider a college class in which your homework average is 90%,
      your test average is 73%, and your final exam grade is an 85%.
      Experience tells us that our final grade
      <em>is not</em> the <em>average</em>
      of these three grades: that is, it is not:
      <me>
        \frac{0.9+0.73+0.85}{3} \approx 0.837 = 83.7%
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is, you are probably not pulling a B in the course.
      Rather, your grades are <em>weighted</em>.
      Let's say the homework is worth 10% of the grade,
      tests are 60% and the exam is 30%.
      Then your final grade is:
      <me>
        (0.1)(0.9) + (0.6)(0.73)+(0.3)(0.85) = 0.783 = 78.3%
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each grade is multiplied by a <em>weight</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, given values <m>x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n</m> and weights <m>w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n</m>,
      the weighted average of the <m>n</m> values is
      <me>
        \sum_{i=1}^n w_ix_i\Bigg/\sum_{i=1}^n w_i
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the grading example above,
      the sum of the weights 0.1, 0.6 and 0.3 is 1, so we don't see the division by the sum of weights in that instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      How this relates to center of mass is given in the following theorem.
    </p>

                Again following <xref ref="thm_center_mass_points"/>, we find:
                <me>
                  \overline{x} = \frac{10(-1)+2(2)+1(3)}{10+2+1} = \frac{-3}{13} \approx -0.23

                Placing a large weight at the left hand side of the system moves the center of mass left,
                as shown in <xref ref="fig_mass4b"/>.

    <p>
      In a discrete system (<ie/>, mass is located at individual points,
      not along a continuum) we find the center of mass by dividing the mass into a
      <em>moment</em> of the system.
      In general, a moment is a weighted measure of distance from a particular point or line.
      In the case described by <xref ref="thm_center_mass_points"/>,
      we are finding a weighted measure of distances from the <m>y</m>-axis,
      so we refer to this as <em>the moment about the <m>y</m>-axis</em>,
      represented by <m>M_y</m>.
      Letting <m>M</m> be the total mass of the system,
      we have <m>\overline{x} = M_y/M</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can extend the concept of the center of mass of discrete points along a line to the center of mass of discrete points in the plane rather easily.
      To do so, we define some terms then give a theorem.

    <p>
      We finally arrive at our true goal of this section:
      finding the center of mass of a lamina with variable density.
      While the above measurement of center of mass is interesting,
      it does not directly answer more realistic situations where we need to find the center of mass of a contiguous region.
      However, understanding the discrete case allows us to approximate the center of mass of a planar lamina;
      using calculus, we can refine the approximation to an exact value.
    </p>

    <p>
      We begin by representing a planar lamina with a region <m>R</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane with density function <m>\delta(x,y)</m>.
      Partition <m>R</m> into <m>n</m> subdivisions,
      each with area <m>\Delta A_i</m>.
      As done before, we can approximate the mass of the
      <m>i</m>th subregion with <m>\delta(x_i,y_i)\Delta A_i</m>,
      where <m>(x_i,y_i)</m> is a point inside the <m>i</m>th subregion.
      We can approximate the moment of this subregion about the <m>y</m>-axis with <m>x_i\delta(x_i,y_i)\Delta A_i</m> <mdash/> that is,
      by multiplying the approximate mass of the region by its approximate distance from the <m>y</m>-axis.
      Similarly, we can approximate the moment about the <m>x</m>-axis with <m>y_i\delta(x_i,y_i)\Delta A_i</m>.
      By summing over all subregions, we have:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ mass: }  M \amp \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \delta(x_i,y_i)\Delta A_i \text{ (as seen before) }</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{ moment about the \(x\)-axis: }  M_x \amp \approx \sum_{i=1}^n y_i\delta(x_i,y_i)\Delta A_i</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{ moment about the \(y\)-axis: }  M_y \amp \approx \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\delta(x_i,y_i)\Delta A_i</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      By taking limits,
      where size of each subregion shrinks to 0 in both the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions,
      we arrive at the double integrals given in the following theorem.

          we find <m>M</m>, <m>M_x</m> and <m>M_y</m>:

        <p>
          Thus the center of mass is <m>\ds (\overline{x},\overline{y}) = \left(\frac{M_y}M,\frac{M_x}M\right) = (1.5/3,1.5/3) = (0.5,0.5)</m>.
          This is what we should have expected:
          the center of mass of a square with constant density is the center of the square.

          While the mass of this lamina is the same as the lamina in the previous example,

          As done in <xref ref="ex_mass3"/>,
          it is best to describe <m>R</m> using polar coordinates.
          Thus when we compute <m>M_y</m>,
          we will integrate not <m>x\delta(x,y) = x(x^2+y^2+1)</m>,
          but rather <m>\big(r\cos(\theta) \big)\delta(r\cos(\theta) ,r\sin(\theta) ) = \big(r\cos(\theta) \big)\big(r^2+1\big)</m>.
          We compute <m>M</m>, <m>M_x</m> and <m>M_y</m>:

            <mrow>M_x \amp = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^2 (r\sin(\theta) )(r^2+1)r \, dr\, d\theta = 0</mrow>

        <p>
          Since <m>R</m> and the density of <m>R</m> are both symmetric about the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes,
          it should come as no big surprise that the moments about each axis is 0.
          Thus the center of mass is <m>(\overline{x},\overline{y})=(0,0)</m>.

          Using the description of <m>R</m> and/or the illustration,

          As the lamina is symmetric about the <m>y</m>-axis,

          <p>
            <em>The moment of inertia</em>
            <m>I</m> is a measure of the tendency of a lamina to resist rotating about an axis or continue to rotate about an axis.
            <m>I_x</m> is the moment of inertia about the <m>x</m>-axis,
            <m>I_y</m> is the moment of inertia about the <m>y</m>-axis,
            and <m>I_O</m> is the moment of inertia about the origin.
            These are computed as follows:
          </p>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><m>I_x = \iint_R y^2\, dm</m></li>

              <li><m>I_y = \iint_R x^2\, dm</m></li>

              <li><m>I_O = \iint_R \big(x^2+y^2\big)\, dm</m></li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            In the following exercises,
            a lamina corresponding to a planar region <m>R</m> is given with a mass of 16 units.
            For each, compute <m>I_x</m>,
            <m>I_y</m> and <m>I_O</m>.
