  <title>One-Sided Limits</title>

  <p>
    We introduced the concept of a limit gently,
    approximating their values graphically and numerically.
    Next came the rigorous definition of the limit,
    along with an admittedly tedious method for evaluating them.
    <xref ref="sec_limit_analytically"/> gave us tools
    (which we call theorems)
    that allow us to compute limits with greater ease.
    Chief among the results were the facts that polynomials and
    rational, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions
    (and their sums, products, etc.)
    all behave <q>nicely.</q>
    In this section we rigorously define what we mean by <q>nicely.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="sec_limit_intro"/>
    we saw three ways in which limits of functions can fail to exist:
    <ol>
      <li xml:id="lim_DNE_lr">
        <p>
          The function approaches different values from the left
          and right.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The function grows without bound.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The function oscillates.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    In this section we explore in depth the concepts behind
    <xref ref="lim_DNE_lr"/> by introducing the <em>one-sided limit</em>.
    We begin with formal definitions that are very similar to the
    definition of the limit given in <xref ref="sec_limit_def"/>,
    but the notation is slightly different and <q><m>x\neq c</m></q>
    is replaced with either <q><m>x\lt c</m></q> or <q><m>x \gt c</m>.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a slightly different definition for a left-hand limit,
    than for a right-hand limit,
    but both have a lot in common with <xref ref="def_limit"/>.

    Practically speaking, when evaluating a left-hand limit,
    we consider only values of <m>x</m>
    <q>to the left of <m>c</m>,</q>
    <ie/>, where <m>x\lt c</m>.
    The admittedly imperfect notation <m>x\to c^-</m> is used to
    imply that we look at values of <m>x</m> to the left of <m>c</m>.
    The notation has nothing to do with positive or negative values
    of either <m>x</m> or <m>c</m>.
    It's more like you are adding very small negative values to
    <m>c</m> to get values for <m>x</m>.
    A similar statement holds for evaluating right-hand limits;
    there we consider only values of <m>x</m> to the right of <m>c</m>,
    <ie/>, <m>x \gt c</m>.
    We can use the theorems from previous sections to help us evaluate these limits;
    we just restrict our view to one side of <m>c</m>.

              Graph of the piecewise function
              <m>f(x) = \begin{cases} x \amp 0\leq x\leq 1 \\ 3-x \amp 1\lt x\lt 2 \end{cases}</m>.
              There are two line segments: for <m>0\leq x\leq 1</m> we have a line segment
              with positive slope, and for <m>1\lt x\lt 2</m> we have a line segment with negative slope.
            </p>
            <p>
              The line segment with a positive slope starts at the point <m>(0, 0)</m>
              and ends at <m>(1, 1)</m>. The line segment with a negative slope starts
              at <m>(1, 2)</m> and ends at <m>(2, 1)</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The start and end points of the line segment with a positive slope
              are solid dots, indicating that those points are part of the graph. 
              The start and end points of the line segment
              with a negative slope are hollow dots. 
              This tells that although the second line segment gets arbitrarily close
              to the points <m>(1,2)</m> and <m>(2,1)</m>, these points are not part of the graph.

              Since <m>f(x)</m> is close to <m>1</m> when <m>x</m> is close to 1, but <m>x\lt 1</m>,
              while <m>f(x)</m> is close to <m>2</m> when <m>x</m> is close to 1, but <m>x\gt 1</m>,
              we can conclude that the left and right hand limits are different.

        For these problems,
        the visual aid of the graph is likely more effective in
        evaluating the limits than using <m>f</m> itself.

    Note how the left- and right-hand limits were different at <m>x=1</m>.
    This, of course, causes <em>the</em> limit to not exist.

    The phrase <q>if, and only if</q>
    means the two statements are <em>equivalent</em>:
    they are either both true or both false.
    If the limit equals <m>L</m>,
    then the left and right hand limits both equal <m>L</m>.
    If the limit is not equal to <m>L</m>,
    then at least one of the left and right-hand limits is not equal to
    <m>L</m> (it may not even exist).

    is that the value of the function may/may not be equal to the value(s)
    of its left/right-hand limits, even when these limits agree.

              Graph of <m>f</m> from <xref ref="ex_onesideb"/>.
              The graph consists of two parts.
              The first part is a line that starts at the point <m>(0, 2)</m> and ends at
              <m>(1, 1)</m>. The second part is a curve that starts at <m>(1, 1)</m> and ends
              at <m>(2, 0)</m>.
              The points <m>(0,2)</m>, <m>(1,1)</m>, and <m>(2,0)</m> are all marked with hollow dots,
              indicating that although the graph gets close to these points, they are not part of the graph.
            </p>
            <p>
              The function is undefined for <m>x = 1</m>,
              but the graph shows that <m>f(x)</m> approaches the same value (namely, 1)
              from both the left and the right, allowing us to conclude that <m>\lim_{x\to 1}f(x)</m> exists,
              and is equal to 1.

  <p>
    Only in <xref ref="ex_onesided"/>
    do both the function and the limit exist and agree.
    This seems <q>nice;</q> in fact,
    it seems <q>normal.</q> This is in fact an important situation which we explore in <xref ref="sec_continuity"/>
    entitled <q>Continuity.</q> In short,
    a <term>continuous function</term>
    is one in which when a function approaches a value as <m>x\to c</m> (<ie/>, when <m>\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = L</m>),
    it actually <em>attains</em> that value at <m>c</m>.
    Such functions behave nicely as they are very predictable.

                    The graph is
                    made up of eight separate lines that do not connect to each
                    other. Each of the lines is parallel with the <m>x</m> axis, defined
                    by a solid dot on its left and a hollow dot on its right, and
                    has a length of <m>1</m> unit. The first line is inside quadrant <m>3</m>
                    of the graph and the last is in quadrant <m>1</m>, there are no
                    lines in quadrants <m>2</m> or <m>4</m>. Each of the other six lines is between
                    the first and last line moving along a straight diagonal path.
                  </p>
                  <p>
