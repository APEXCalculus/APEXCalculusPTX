  <title>Work</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      <em>Work</em> is the scientific term used to describe the action of a force which moves an object.
      When a constant force <m>F</m> is applied to move an object a distance <m>d</m>,
      the amount of work performed is <m>W=F\cdot d</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The SI unit of force is the <term>newton</term>; one newton is equal to one
      <quantity><unit prefix="kilo" base="gram"/><unit base="meter"/><per base="second" exp="2"/></quantity>,
      and the SI unit of distance is a meter (m).
      The fundamental unit of work is one newton<ndash/>meter,
      or a <term>joule</term> (J).
      That is, applying a force of one newton for one meter performs one joule of work.
      In Imperial units
      (as used in the United States),
      force is measured in pounds (lb) and distance is measured in feet (ft),
      hence work is measured in ft<ndash/>lb.
    </p>
    <aside vshift="0">
      <p>
        <em>Mass</em> and <em>weight</em>
        are closely related, yet different, concepts.
        The mass <m>m</m> of an object is a quantitative measure of that object's resistance to acceleration.
        The weight <m>w</m> of an object is a measurement of the force applied to the object by the acceleration of gravity <m>g</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the two measurements are proportional, <m>w=m\cdot g</m>,
        they are often used interchangeably in everyday conversation.
        When computing work,
        one must be careful to note which is being referred to.
        When mass is given,
        it must be multiplied by the acceleration of gravity to reference the related force.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      When force is constant, the measurement of work is straightforward.
      For instance, lifting a <quantity><mag>200</mag><unit base="pound"/></quantity>
      object <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> performs
      <m>200\cdot 5 = 1000</m> ft<ndash/>lb of work.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if the force applied is variable?
      For instance,
      imagine a climber pulling a <quantity><mag>200</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> rope up a vertical face.
      The rope becomes lighter as more is pulled in,
      requiring less force and hence the climber performs less work.

    <title>Work Done by a Variable Force</title>
    <p>
      In general, let <m>F(x)</m> be a force function on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
      We want to measure the amount of work done applying the force <m>F</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>.
      We can approximate the amount of work being done by partitioning <m>[a,b]</m> into subintervals
      <m>a=x_0\lt x_1 \lt \cdots \lt x_{n}=b</m> and assuming that <m>F</m> is constant on each subinterval.
      Let <m>c_i</m> be a value in the
      <m>i</m>th subinterval <m>[x_{i-1},x_{i}]</m>.
      Then the work done on this interval is approximately <m>W_i\approx F(c_i)\cdot(x_{i}-x_{i-1}) = F(c_i)\dx_i</m>,
      a constant force <times/> the distance over which it is applied.
      The total work is
      <me>
        W = \sum_{i=1}^n W_i \approx \sum_{i=1}^n F(c_i)\dx_i
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This, of course, is a Riemann sum.
      Taking a limit as the subinterval lengths go to zero gives an exact value of work which can be evaluated through a definite integral.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A <quantity><mag>60</mag><unit base="meter"/></quantity> climbing rope is hanging over the side of a tall cliff.
          How much work is performed in pulling the rope up to the top,
          where the rope has a linear mass density of
          <quantity><mag>66</mag><unit base="gram"/><per base="meter"/></quantity>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We need to create a force function <m>F(x)</m> on the interval <m>[0,60]</m>.
          To do so, we must first decide what <m>x</m> is measuring:
          is it the length of the rope still hanging or is it the amount of rope pulled in?
          As long as we are consistent, either approach is fine.
          We adopt for this example the convention that <m>x</m> is the amount of rope pulled in.
          This seems to match intuition better;
          pulling up the first <m>10</m> meters of rope involves <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=10</m> instead of <m>x=60</m> to <m>x=50</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As <m>x</m> is the amount of rope pulled in,
          the amount of rope still hanging is <m>60-x</m>.
          This length of rope has a mass of <quantity><mag>66</mag><unit base="gram"/><per base="meter"/></quantity> or
          <quantity><mag>0.066</mag><unit prefix="kilo" base="gram"/><per base="meter"/></quantity>.
          The mass of the rope still hanging is <m>0.066(60-x)</m> <quantity><unit prefix="kilo" base="gram"/></quantity>;
          multiplying this mass by the acceleration of gravity,
          <quantity><mag>9.8</mag><unit base="meter"/><per base="second" exp="2"/></quantity>,
          gives our variable force function
          <me>
            F(x) = (9.8)(0.066)(60-x) = 0.6468(60-x)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus the total work performed in pulling up the rope is
          <me>
            W = \int_0^{60} 0.6468(60-x)\, dx = 1,164.24 \,\text{J}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          By comparison,
          consider the work done in lifting the entire rope <m>60</m> meters.
          The rope weighs <m>60\times 0.066 \times 9.8 = 38.808</m> N, so the work applying this force for <m>60</m> meters is
          <m>60\times 38.808 = 2,328.48</m> J. This is exactly twice the work calculated before (and we leave it to the reader to understand why.)

          we know the total work performed is <m>1,164.24</m> J.

          to a height of <m>x=h</m> is <m>582.12</m>, or half the total work.
          Thus we want to solve the equation
          <me>
            \int_0^h 0.6468(60-x)\, dx = 582.12
          </me>

        <p>
          As the rope is only <quantity><mag>60</mag><unit base="meter"/></quantity> long,
          the only sensible answer is <m>h=17.57</m>.
          Thus about half the work is done pulling up the first

                We start by forming the force function <m>F_r(x)</m> for the rope
                (where the subscript denotes we are considering the rope).
                As in the previous example,
                let <m>x</m> denote the amount of rope, in feet, pulled in.
                (This is the same as saying <m>x</m> denotes the height of the box.)
                The weight of the rope with <m>x</m> feet pulled in is <m>F_r(x) = 0.2(50-x) = 10-0.2x</m>.
                (Note that we do not have to include the acceleration of gravity here,
                for the <em>weight</em> of the rope per foot is given,
                not its <em>mass</em> per meter as before.) The work performed lifting the rope is
                <me>
                  W_r = \int_0^{50} (10-0.2x)\, dx = 250\,\text{ft--lb}

            <li>
              <p>
                The sand is leaving the box at a rate of
                <quantity><mag>1</mag><unit base="pound"/><per base="second"/></quantity>.
                As the vertical trip is to take one minute,
                we know that <quantity><mag>60</mag><unit base="pound"/></quantity>
                will have left when the box reaches its final height of
                <quantity><mag>50</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity>.
                Again letting <m>x</m> represent the height of the box,
                we have two points on the line that describes the weight of the sand:
                when <m>x=0</m>, the sand weight is
                <quantity><mag>100</mag><unit base="pound"/></quantity>,
                producing the point <m>(0,100)</m>;
                when <m>x=50</m>, the sand in the box weighs
                <quantity><mag>40</mag><unit base="pound"/></quantity>,
                producing the point <m>(50,40)</m>.
                The slope of this line is <m>\frac{100-40}{0-50} = -1.2</m>,
                giving the equation of the weight of the sand at height <m>x</m> as <m>w(x) = -1.2x+100</m>.
                The box itself weighs a constant
                <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="pound"/></quantity>,
                so the total force function is <m>F_b(x) = -1.2x+105</m>.
                Integrating from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=50</m> gives the work performed in lifting box and sand:
                <me>
                  W_b = \int_0^{50} (-1.2x+105)\, dx = 3750\,\text{ft--lb}

    <title>Hooke's Law and Springs</title>

    <p>
      Hooke's Law states that the force required to compress or stretch a spring <m>x</m>
      units from its natural length is proportional to <m>x</m>;
      that is, this force is <m>F(x) = kx</m> for some constant <m>k</m>.
      For example, if a force of <quantity><mag>1</mag><unit base="newton"/></quantity>
      stretches a given spring <quantity><mag>2</mag><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>,
      then a force of <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="newton"/></quantity>
      will stretch the spring <quantity><mag>10</mag><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>.
      Converting the distances to meters,
      we have that stretching this spring <quantity><mag>0.02</mag><unit prefix="centi" base="meter"/></quantity>
      requires a force of <m>F(0.02) = k(0.02) = 1</m>
      <quantity><unit base="newton"/></quantity>,
      hence <m>k = 1/0.02 = 50</m>

        <p>
          In many ways,
          we are not at all concerned with the actual length of the spring,
          only with the amount of its change.
          Hence, we do not care that <quantity><mag>20</mag><unit base="pound"/></quantity>
          of force stretches the spring to a length of <m>12</m> inches,
          but rather that a force of

          stretches the spring by <m>5</m> inches.
          This is illustrated in <xref ref="fig_spring1"/>;
          we only measure the change in the spring's length,
          not the overall length of the spring.

    <title>Pumping Fluids</title>
    <p>
      Another useful example of the application of integration to compute work comes in the pumping of fluids,
      often illustrated in the context of emptying a storage tank by pumping the fluid out the top.
      This situation is different than our previous examples for the forces involved are constant.
      After all, the force required to move one cubic foot of water (about <quantity><mag>62.4</mag><unit base="pound"/></quantity> ) 
      is the same regardless of its location in the tank.
      What is variable is the distance that cubic foot of water has to travel;
      water closer to the top travels less distance than water at the bottom,
      producing less work.

        <p>
          We start as we often do: we partition an interval into subintervals.
          We orient our tank vertically since this makes intuitive sense with the base of the tank at <m>y=0</m>.
          Hence the top of the water is at <m>y=30</m>,
          meaning we are interested in subdividing the <m>y</m>-interval <m>[0,30]</m> into <m>n</m> subintervals as
          <me>
            0 = y_0 \lt  y_1 \lt  \cdots \lt  y_{n} = 30
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider the work <m>W_i</m> of pumping only the water residing in the <m>i</m>th subinterval,
          illustrated in <xref ref="fig_pump1a"/>.
          The force required to move this water is equal to its weight which we calculate as volume <times/> density.
          The volume of water in this subinterval is <m>V_i = 10^2\pi \Delta y_i</m>;
          its density is <quantity><mag>62.4</mag><unit base="pound"/><per base="foot" exp="3"/></quantity>.
          Thus the required force is <m>6240\pi\Delta y_i</m> <quantity><unit base="pound"/></quantity>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We approximate the distance the force is applied by using any <m>y</m>-value contained in the <m>i</m>th subinterval;
          for simplicity, we arbitrarily use <m>y_i</m> for now
          (it will not matter later on).
          The water will be pumped to a point <m>5</m> feet above the top of the tank, that is,
          to the height of <m>y=35</m> <quantity><unit base="foot"/></quantity>.
          Thus the distance the water at height <m>y_i</m> travels is <m>35-y_i</m> <quantity><unit base="foot"/></quantity>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In all, the approximate work <m>W_i</m> performed in moving the water in the
          <m>i</m>th subinterval to a point <m>5</m> feet above the tank is
          <me>
            W_i \approx 6240\pi\Delta y_i(35-y_i)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To approximate the total work performed in pumping out all the water from the tank,
          we sum all the work <m>W_i</m> performed in pumping the water from each of the <m>n</m> subintervals of <m>[0,30]</m>:
          <me>
            W \approx \sum_{i=1}^n W_i = \sum_{i=1}^n 6240\pi\Delta y_i(35-y_i)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a Riemann sum.
          Taking the limit as the subinterval length goes to 0 gives
          <md>
            <mrow>W   \amp =  \int_0^{30} 6240\pi(35-y)\, dy</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =  6240\pi\left(35y-1/2y^2\right)\Big|_0^{30}</mrow>

              On the left side of the storage tank the <m>y</m>-axis is shown with measurements of <m>y=3</m> which is 3 feet above the tank, <m>y=0</m> which is the top of the tank, and <m>y=-10</m> which is the tip of the cone, 10 feet below ground level.
              The image contains an arbitrarily chosen point <m>y</m> between <m>y=-10</m> and <m>y=0</m> which is contained in the tank.
              At this point <m>y</m>, the volume is given as <m>V(y)=\pi (\frac{y}{5} + 2)^2 dy</m>, where <m>d</m> is the arbitrarily short distance between the top and bottom of the thin slice of water in the tank at the point <m>y</m>.
              Additionally, the distance from the arbitrary point <m>y</m> and the point <m>3</m> feet above the tank is given on the <m>y</m>-axis as <m>3-y</m>.

        <p>
          The figure also sketches a differential element,
          a cross-sectional circle.
          The radius of this circle is variable, depending on <m>y</m>.
          When <m>y=-10</m>, the circle has radius 0;
          when <m>y=0</m>, the circle has radius 2.
          These two points, <m>(-10,0)</m> and <m>(0,2)</m>,
          allow us to find the equation of the line that gives the radius of the cross-sectional circle,
          which is <m>r(y) = 1/5y+2</m>.
          Hence the volume of water at this height is <m>V(y)=\pi(1/5y+2)^2dy</m>,
          where <m>dy</m> represents a very small height of the differential element.
          The force required to move the water at height <m>y</m> is <m>F(y) = 62.4\times V(y)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The distance the water at height <m>y</m> travels is given by <m>h(y)=3-y</m>.
          Thus the total work done in pumping the water from the tank is
          <md>

              On the <m>y</m> axis are five markings.
              The label <m>y=0</m> marks the bottom of the deep end of the pool, the label <m>y=3</m> marks the bottom of the shallow end of the pool.
              The label <m>y=6</m> marks the top of the water in the pool, and the label <m>y=8</m> marks a point <quantity><mag>2</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> above the top of the water.
              The image also contains an arbitrary label <m>y</m> lying somewhere below the water level of the pool.
              On the <m>x</m>-axis, the label <m>x=0</m> marks the leftmost edge of the pool, <m>x=10</m> marks the end of the deep end and after the pool slopes up to a depth of <quantity><mag>3</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity>, the label <m>x=15</m> marks the start of the shallow end.
              The distance between the leftmost edge and rightmost edge of the pool when <m>y</m> is above <m>y=3</m>, which is the depth of shallow end, is constant, and is given by the length of the pool.
              On the other hand, the distance between the same two edges of the pool when <m>y</m> is below <m>y=3</m> is the length of the deep end, plus the additional distance in the <m>x</m> direction between the end of the deep end, <m>x=10</m>, and the point at which the arbitrary <m>y</m> level meets the sloped portion of the pool.
              The sloped portion of the pool is given as the line which passes through the points <m>(10,0)</m> and <m>(15,3)</m>, which are the end of the deep end, and the start of the shallow end, respectively.

        <p>
          <xref ref="fig_pump_3a"/>
          shows the pool oriented with this <m>y</m>-axis,
          along with 2 differential elements as the pool must be split into two different regions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The top region lies in the <m>y</m>-interval of <m>[3,6]</m>,
          where the length of the differential element is <quantity><mag>25</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> as shown.
          As the pool is <quantity><mag>20</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> wide,
          this differential element represents a thin slice of water with volume <m>V(y) = 20\cdot25\cdot dy</m>.
          The water is to be pumped to a height of <m>y=8</m>,
          so the height function is <m>h(y) = 8-y</m>.
          The work done in pumping this top region of water is
          <me>
            W_t = 62.4\int_3^6 500(8-y)\, dy = 327,600 \,\text{ft--lb}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bottom region lies in the <m>y</m>-interval of <m>[0,3]</m>;
          we need to compute the length of the differential element in this interval.
        </p>

        <p>
          One end of the differential element is at <m>x=0</m> and the other is along the line segment joining the points <m>(10,0)</m> and <m>(15,3)</m>.
          The equation of this line is <m>y= 3/5(x-10)</m>;
          as we will be integrating with respect to <m>y</m>,
          we rewrite this equation as <m>x=5/3y+10</m>.
          So the length of the differential element is a difference of <m>x</m>-values:
          <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=5/3y+10</m>,
          giving a length of <m>x=5/3y+10</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Again, as the pool is <quantity><mag>20</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> wide,
          this differential element represents a thin slice of water with volume <m>V(y) = 20\cdot(5/3y+10)\cdot dy</m>;
          the height function is the same as before at <m>h(y)=8-y</m>.
          The work performed in emptying this part of the pool is
          <me>
            W_b = 62.4\int_0^3 20(5/3y+10)(8-y)\, dy = 299,520\,\text{ft--lb}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The total work in empyting the pool is
          <me>
            W = W_b+W_t = 327,600+299,520 = 627,120\,\text{ft--lb}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice how the emptying of the bottom of the pool performs almost as much work as emptying the top.
          The top portion travels a shorter distance but has more water.
          In the end, this extra water produces more work.

            Note that the tank is oriented horizontally.
            Let the origin be the center of one of the circular ends of the tank.
            Since the radius is <quantity><mag>3.75</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity>, the fluid is being pumped to <m>y=4.75</m>;
            thus the distance the gas travels is <m>h(y)=4.75-y</m>.
            A differential element of water is a rectangle,
            with length 20 and width <m>2\sqrt{3.75^2-y^2}</m>.
            Thus the force required to move that slab of gas is <m>F(y) = 40\cdot45.93\cdot\sqrt{3.75^2-y^2}dy</m>.
            Total work is <m>\int_{-3.75}^{3.75} 40\cdot45.93\cdot(4.75-y)\sqrt{3.75^2-y^2}\, dy</m>.
            This can be evaluated without actual integration;
            split the integral into <m>\int_{-3.75}^{3.75} 40\cdot45.93\cdot(4.75)\sqrt{3.75^2-y^2}\, dy + \int_{-3.75}^{3.75} 40\cdot45.93\cdot(-y)\sqrt{3.75^2-y^2}\, dy</m>.
            The first integral can be evaluated as measuring half the area of a circle;
            the latter integral can be shown to be 0 without much difficulty.
