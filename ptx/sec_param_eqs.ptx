      We are familiar with sketching shapes,
      such as parabolas, by following this basic procedure:

            A diagram containing mostly text, that outlines the process for plotting a function.
            The steps illustrated are as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Choose <m>x</m>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Use function <m>f</m> to find <m>y</m> (<m>y=f(x)</m>)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Plot point <m>(x,y)</m>
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>
            This is not really indicative of how a person would sketch a graph by hand
            (better techniques for doing so were covered in <xref ref="sec_sketch"/>),
            but it is not far off from how a computer might generate a plot,
            or how a student who is first learning about functions might use a table of values to create a plot.

      The <em>rectangular equation</em>
      <m>y=f(x)</m> works well for some shapes like a parabola with a vertical axis of symmetry,
      but in the previous section we encountered several shapes that could not be sketched in this manner. (To plot an ellipse using the above procedure,
      we need to plot the <q>top</q> and <q>bottom</q>
      separately.)<idx><h>curve</h><h>rectangular equation</h></idx>

            This is another text-based diagram, which illustrates the method for plotting curves that will be covered in this section.
            In this method, the coordinates <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both defined as functions of a third variable, <m>t</m>.
            Four phrases are arranged in a diamond shape, with text left, right, top, and bottom.

          <p>
            To the left of the diagram is the text, <q>Choose <m>t</m></q>.
            An arrow points up and to the left from this text to the phrase <q>Use a function <m>f</m> to find <m>x</m> (<m>x=f(t)</m>)</q>,
            which is located at the top of the diagram.
            Another arrow points down and to the left from <q>Choose <m>t</m></q> to the phrase
            <q>Use a function <m>g</m> to find <m>y</m> (<m>y=g(t)</m>)</q>, which is located at the bottom of the diagram.

          <p>
            From the phrases at the top and bottom of the diagram there are two more arrows pointing to the right,
            to a final phrase, which states, <q>Plot point <m>(x,y)</m></q>.

      This is a formal definition of the word <em>curve</em>.
      When a curve lies in a plane
      (such as the Cartesian plane),
      it is often referred to as a <em>plane curve</em>.
      Examples will help us understand the concepts introduced in the definition.

          We plot the graphs of parametric equations in much the same manner as we plotted graphs of functions like <m>y=f(x)</m>:
          we make a table of values, plot points,
          then connect these points with a
          <q>reasonable</q> looking curve.
          <xref ref="fig_pareq1a"/> shows such a table of values;
          note how we have 3 columns.
        </p>

        <p>
          The points <m>(x,y)</m> from the table are plotted in <xref ref="fig_pareq1b"/>.
          The points have been connected with a smooth curve.
          Each point has been labeled with its corresponding <m>t</m>-value.
          These values, along with the two arrows along the curve,
          are used to indicate the <em>orientation</em> of the graph.
          This information helps us determine the direction in which the graph is <q>moving.</q>

        <p>
          It is not difficult to show that the curves in <xref ref="ex_pareq1" text="global">Examples</xref>
          and <xref ref="ex_pareq2" text="global"/>
          are portions of the same parabola.
          While the <em>parabola</em> is the same,
          the <em>curves</em> are different.
          In <xref ref="ex_pareq1"/>,
          if we let <m>t</m> vary over all real numbers,
          we'd obtain the entire parabola.
          In this example,
          letting <m>t</m> vary over all real numbers would still produce the same graph;
          this portion of the parabola would be traced,
          and re-traced, infinitely many times.
          The orientation shown in <xref ref="fig_pareq2"/>
          shows the orientation on <m>[0,\pi]</m>,
          but this orientation is reversed on <m>[\pi,2\pi]</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          These examples begin to illustrate the powerful nature of parametric equations.
          Their graphs are far more diverse than the graphs of functions produced by
          <q><m>y=f(x)</m></q> functions.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      <em>Technology Note:</em> Most graphing utilities can graph functions given in parametric form.
      Often the word <q>parametric</q>
      is abbreviated as <q>PAR</q>
      or <q>PARAM</q> in the options.
      The user usually needs to determine the graphing window (i.e, the minimum and maximum <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-values),
      along with the values of <m>t</m> that are to be plotted.
      The user is often prompted to give a <m>t</m> minimum,
      a <m>t</m> maximum,
      and a <q><m>t</m>-step</q> or <q><m>\Delta t</m>.</q>
      Graphing utilities effectively plot parametric functions just as we've shown here:
      they plots lots of points.
      A smaller <m>t</m>-step plots more points,
      making for a smoother graph
      (but may take longer).
      In <xref ref="fig_pareq1"/>, the <m>t</m>-step is 1;
      in <xref ref="fig_pareq2"/>,
      the <m>t</m>-step is <m>\pi/4</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      One nice feature of parametric equations is that their graphs are easy to shift.
      While this is not too difficult in the
      <q><m>y=f(x)</m></q> context,
      the resulting function can look rather messy.
      (Plus, to shift to the right by two,
      we replace <m>x</m> with <m>x-2</m>,
      which is counter-intuitive.)
      The following example demonstrates this.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_pareq3">
      <title>Shifting the graph of parametric functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Sketch the graph of the parametric equations <m>x=t^2+t</m>,
          <m>y=t^2-t</m>.
          Find new parametric equations that shift this graph to the right 3 places and down 2.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The graph of the parametric equations is given in <xref ref="fig_pareq3a"/>.
          It is a parabola with a axis of symmetry along the line <m>y=x</m>;
          the vertex is at <m>(0,0)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to shift the graph to the right 3 units,
          we need to increase the <m>x</m>-value by 3 for every point.
          The straightforward way to accomplish this is simply to add 3 to the function defining <m>x</m>:
          <m>x = t^2+t+3</m>.
          To shift the graph down by 2 units,
          we wish to decrease each <m>y</m>-value by 2, so we subtract 2 from the function defining <m>y</m>:
          <m>y = t^2-t-2</m>.
          Thus our parametric equations for the shifted graph are <m>x=t^2+t+3</m>,
          <m>y=t^2-t-2</m>.
          This is graphed in <xref ref="fig_pareq3a"/>.
          Notice how the vertex is now at <m>(3,-2)</m>.

    <title>Converting between rectangular and parametric equations</title>
    <p>
      It is sometimes useful to rewrite equations in rectangular form (<ie/>, <m>y=f(x)</m>) into parametric form,
      and vice-versa.
      Converting from rectangular to parametric can be very simple:
      given <m>y=f(x)</m>, the parametric equations <m>x=t</m>,
      <m>y=f(t)</m> produce the same graph.
      As an example, given <m>y=x^2</m>,
      the parametric equations <m>x=t</m>,
      <m>y=t^2</m> produce the familiar parabola.
      However, other parametrizations can be used.
      The following example demonstrates one possible alternative.

          Find parametric equations <m>x=f(t)</m>,
          <m>y=g(t)</m> for the parabola where <m>t=\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
          That is, <m>t=a</m> corresponds to the point on the graph whose tangent line has slope <m>a</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We start by computing <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>: <m>y' = 2x</m>.
          Thus we set <m>t=2x</m>.
          We can solve for <m>x</m> and find <m>x= t/2</m>.
          Knowing that <m>y=x^2</m>, we have <m>y= t^2/4</m>.
          Thus parametric equations for the parabola <m>y=x^2</m> are
          <me>
            x=t/2  y=t^2/4
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To find the point where the tangent line has a slope of <m>-2</m>,
          we set <m>t=-2</m>.
          This gives the point <m>(-1, 1)</m>.
          We can verify that the slope of the line tangent to the curve at this point indeed has a slope of <m>-2</m>.

        <p>
          An object is fired from a height of 0 feet and lands 6 seconds later, 192 feet away.
          Assuming ideal projectile motion, the height, in feet,
          of the object can be described by <m>h(x) = -x^2/64+3x</m>,
          where <m>x</m> is the distance in feet from the initial location. (Thus
          <m>h(0) = h(192) = 0</m> feet.) Find parametric equations <m>x=f(t)</m>,
          <m>y=g(t)</m> for the path of the projectile where <m>x</m> is the horizontal distance the object has traveled at time <m>t</m>
          (in seconds)
          and <m>y</m> is the height at time <m>t</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Physics tells us that the horizontal motion of the projectile is linear;
          that is, the horizontal speed of the projectile is constant.
          Since the object travels <quantity><mag>192</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> in <quantity><mag>6</mag><unit base="second"/></quantity>,
          we deduce that the object is moving horizontally at a rate of <quantity><mag>32</mag><unit base="foot"/><per base="second"/></quantity>,
          giving the equation <m>x=32t</m>.
          As <m>y=-x^2/64+3x</m>, we find <m>y= -16t^2+96t</m>.
          We can quickly verify that <m>y''=-32</m> <quantity><unit base="foot"/><per base="foot" exp="2"/></quantity>,
          the acceleration due to gravity,
          and that the projectile reaches its maximum at <m>t=3</m>,
          halfway along its path.
        </p>

        <p>
          These parametric equations make certain determinations about the object's location easy:

      It is sometimes necessary to convert given parametric equations into rectangular form.
      This can be decidedly more difficult,
      as some <q>simple</q> looking parametric equations can have very
      <q>complicated</q> rectangular equations.
      This conversion is often referred to as
      <q>eliminating the parameter,</q>
      as we are looking for a relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> that does not involve the parameter <m>t</m>.

          The parametric equations limit <m>x</m> to values in <m>(0,1]</m>,

                  The epicycloid <m>x=4\cos(t)-\cos(4t), y=4\sin(t)-\sin(4t)</m> is shown.
                  The curve travels once around the origin, and consists of three arcs,
                  with each pair of arcs meeting at a cusp.

                  The effect is not unlike the appearance of a three-leaf clover,
                  if the leaves were much more puffy, and further from the center.

      Consider the astroid, given by <m>x=\cos^3(t)</m>, <m>y=\sin^3(t)</m>.
      Taking derivatives, we have:

    <p>
      It is clear that each is 0 when <m>t=0,\, \pi/2,\, \pi,\ldots</m>.
      Thus the astroid is not smooth at these points,
      corresponding to the cusps seen in the figure.

    <p>
      If a curve is not smooth at <m>t=t_0</m>,
      it means that <m>x'(t_0)=y'(t_0)=0</m> as defined.
      This, in turn, means that rate of change of <m>x</m>
      (and <m>y</m>)
      is 0;
      that is, at that instant, neither <m>x</m> nor <m>y</m> is changing.
      If the parametric equations describe the path of some object,
      this means the object is at rest at <m>t_0</m>.
      An object at rest can make a <q>sharp</q> change in direction,
      whereas moving objects tend to change direction in a <q>smooth</q> fashion.
    </p>

    <p>
      One should be careful to note that a <q>sharp corner</q>
      does not have to occur when a curve is not smooth.
      For instance, one can verify that <m>x=t^3</m>,
      <m>y=t^6</m> produce the familiar <m>y=x^2</m> parabola.
      However, in this parametrization, the curve is not smooth.
      A particle traveling along the parabola according to the given parametric equations comes to rest at <m>t=0</m>,
      though no sharp point is created.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our previous experience with cusps taught us that a function was not differentiable at a cusp.
      This can lead us to wonder about derivatives in the context of parametric equations and the application of other calculus concepts.
      Given a curve defined parametrically,
      how do we find the slopes of tangent lines?
      Can we determine concavity?
      We explore these concepts and more in the next section.
