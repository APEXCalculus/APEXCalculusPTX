  <title>Directional Derivatives</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Partial derivatives give us an understanding of how a surface changes when we move in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions.
      We made the comparison to standing in a rolling meadow and heading due east:
      the amount of rise/fall in doing so is comparable to <m>f_x</m>.
      Likewise, the rise/fall in moving due north is comparable to <m>f_y</m>.
      The steeper the slope, the greater in magnitude <m>f_y</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what if we didn't move due north or east?
      What if we needed to move northeast and wanted to measure the amount of rise/fall?
      Partial derivatives alone cannot measure this.
      This section investigates <em>directional derivatives</em>,
      which do measure this rate of change.

        <p>
          Let <m>z=f(x,y)</m> be continuous on a set <m>S</m> and let <m>\vec u = \la u_1,u_2\ra</m> be a unit vector.
          For all points <m>(x,y)</m>,
          the <term>directional derivative</term> of <m>f</m> at <m>(x,y)</m> in the direction of <m>\vec u</m>

    <p>
      The partial derivatives <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m> are defined with similar limits,
      but only <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> varies with <m>h</m>, not both.
      Here both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> vary with a weighted <m>h</m>,
      determined by a particular unit vector <m>\vec u</m>.
      This may look a bit intimidating but in reality it is not too difficult to deal with;
      it often just requires extra algebra.
      However, the following theorem reduces this algebraic load.

              <p>
                Let <m>\vec u_1</m> be the unit vector that points from the point <m>(1,2)</m> to the point <m>Q=(3,4)</m>,
                as shown in the figure.
                The vector <m>\overrightarrow{PQ} = \la 2,2\ra</m>;
                the unit vector in this direction is <m>\vec u_1=\la 1/\sqrt{2}, 1/\sqrt{2}\ra</m>.
                Thus the directional derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>(1,2)</m> in the direction of <m>\vec u_1</m> is
                <me>
                  D_{\vec u_1}f(1,2) = -2(1/\sqrt{2}) +(-4)(1/\sqrt{2}) = -6/\sqrt{2}\approx -4.24
                </me>.
                Thus the instantaneous rate of change in moving from the point <m>(1,2,9)</m> on the surface in the direction of <m>\vec u_1</m>
                (which points toward the point <m>Q</m>)
                is about <m>-4.24</m>.
                Moving in this direction moves one steeply downward.

              <p>
                We seek the directional derivative in the direction of <m>\la 2,-1\ra</m>.
                The unit vector in this direction is <m>\vec u_2 = \la 2/\sqrt{5},-1/\sqrt{5}\ra</m>.
                Thus the directional derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>(1,2)</m> in the direction of <m>\vec u_2</m> is
                <me>
                  D_{\vec u_2}f(1,2) = -2(2/\sqrt{5})+(-4)(-1/\sqrt{5}) = 0
                </me>.
                Starting on the surface of <m>f</m> at <m>(1,2)</m> and moving in the direction of <m>\la 2,-1\ra</m>
                (or <m>\vec u_2</m>)
                results in no instantaneous change in <m>z</m>-value.
                This is analogous to standing on the side of a hill and choosing a direction to walk that does not change the elevation.
                One neither walks up nor down,
                rather just <q>along the side</q> of the hill.
                Finding these directions of <q>no elevation change</q> is important.

                At <m>P=(1,2)</m>,
                the direction towards the origin is given by the vector <m>\la -1,-2\ra</m>;
                the unit vector in this direction is <m>\vec u_3=\la -1/\sqrt{5},-2/\sqrt{5}\ra</m>.
                The directional derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>P</m> in the direction of the origin is

                  D_{\vec u_3}f(1,2) = -2(-1/\sqrt{5}) + (-4)(-2/\sqrt{5}) = 10/\sqrt{5} \approx 4.47
                </me>.
                Moving towards the origin means
                <q>walking uphill</q> quite steeply,

      Given that the directional derivative gives the instantaneous rate of change of <m>z</m> when moving in the direction of <m>\vec u</m>,

      This result is rather amazing.
      Once again imagine standing in a rolling meadow and face the direction that leads you steepest uphill.
      Then the direction that leads steepest downhill is directly behind you,
      and side-stepping either left or right (<ie/>, moving perpendicularly to the direction you face) does not change your elevation at all.

      Recall that a level curve is defined as a curve in the <m>xy</m>-plane along which the <m>z</m>-values of a function do not change.
      Let a surface <m>z=f(x,y)</m> be given,
      and let's represent one such level curve as a vector-valued function,
      <m>\vrt = \la x(t), y(t)\ra</m>.
      As the output of <m>f</m> does not change along this curve,
      <m>f\big(x(t),y(t)\big) = c</m> for all <m>t</m>,
      for some constant <m>c</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>f</m> is constant for all <m>t</m>, <m>\frac{df}{dt} = 0</m>.
      By the Multivariable Chain Rule, we also know
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{df}{dt} \amp = f_x(x,y)x'(t) + f_y(x,y)y'(t)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \la f_x(x,y),f_y(x,y)\ra \cdot \la x'(t),y'(t)\ra</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \nabla f \cdot \vrp(t)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =0</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This last equality states <m>\nabla f \cdot \vrp(t) = 0</m>:
      the gradient is orthogonal to the derivative of <m>\vec r</m>,
      meaning the gradient is orthogonal to the graph of <m>\vec r</m>.
      Our conclusion: at any point on a surface,
      the gradient at that point is orthogonal to the level curve that passes through that point.
    </p>

    <p>
      We restate these ideas in a theorem,
      then use them in an example.

      <title>Finding directions of maximal and minimal increase</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x,y) = \sin(x) \cos(y)</m> and let <m>P=(\pi/3,\pi/3)</m>.
          Find the directions of maximal/minimal increase,
          and find a direction where the instantaneous rate of <m>z</m> change is 0.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We begin by finding the gradient.
          <m>f_x = \cos(x) \cos(y)</m> and <m>f_y = -\sin(x) \sin(y)</m>, thus
          <me>
            \nabla f = \la \cos(x) \cos(y) ,-\sin(x) \sin(y) \ra  \text{ and, at \(P\), }   \nabla f\left(\frac{\pi}3,\frac{\pi}3\right) = \la\frac14,-\frac34\ra
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus the direction of maximal increase is <m>\la 1/4, -3/4\ra</m>.
          In this direction,
          the instantaneous rate of <m>z</m> change is <m>\norm{\la 1/4,-3/4\ra} = \sqrt{10}/4 \approx 0.79</m>.

        <p>
          <xref ref="fig_direct2">Figure</xref>
          shows the surface plotted from two different perspectives.
          In each, the gradient is drawn at <m>P</m> with a dashed line
          (because of the nature of this surface,
          the gradient points <q>into</q> the surface).
          Let <m>\vec u = \la u_1, u_2\ra</m> be the unit vector in the direction of <m>\nabla f</m> at <m>P</m>.
          Each graph of the figure also contains the vector <m>\la u_1, u_2, \norm{\nabla f\,}\ra</m>.
          This vector has a <q>run</q> of 1
          (because in the <m>xy</m>-plane it moves 1 unit)
          and a <q>rise</q> of <m>\norm{\nabla f}</m>,
          hence we can think of it as a vector with slope of
          <m>\norm{\nabla f}</m> in the direction of <m>\nabla f</m>,
          helping us visualize how <q>steep</q>
          the surface is in its steepest direction.

          The unit vector in the direction of
          <m>\la 3,1\ra</m> is shown in each graph of the figure as well.
          The level curve at <m>z=\sqrt{3}/4</m> is drawn:
          recall that along this curve the <m>z</m>-values do not change.
          Since <m>\la 3,1\ra</m> is a direction of no <m>z</m>-change,
          this vector is tangent to the level curve at <m>P</m>.

          It is fine to give an answer of <m>\vec 0 = \la 0,0\ra</m>,
          as this indicates that all directional derivatives are 0.

    <p>
      The fact that the gradient of a surface always points in the direction of steepest increase/decrease is very useful,
      as illustrated in the following example.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_direct3">
      <title>The flow of water downhill</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the surface given by the graph of <m>f(x,y)= 20-x^2-2y^2</m>.
          Water is poured on the surface at <m>(1,1/4)</m>.
          What path does it take as it flows downhill?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>\vrt = \la x(t),
          y(t)\ra</m> be the vector-valued function describing the path of the water in the <m>xy</m>-plane;
          we seek <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m>.
          We know that water will always flow downhill in the steepest direction;
          therefore, at any point on its path,
          it will be moving in the direction of <m>-\nabla f</m>.
          (We ignore the physical effects of momentum on the water.)
          Thus <m>\vrp(t)</m> will be parallel to <m>\nabla f</m>,
          and there is some constant <m>c</m> such that <m>c\nabla f = \vrp(t) = \la x'(t),
          y'(t)\ra</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We find <m>\nabla f = \la -2x, -4y\ra</m> and write <m>x'(t)</m> as
          <m>\frac{dx}{dt}</m> and <m>y'(t)</m> as <m>\frac{dy}{dt}</m>.
          Then
          <md>
            <mrow>c\nabla f \amp = \la x'(t), y'(t)\ra</mrow>
            <mrow>\la -2cx, -4cy \ra \amp  = \la \frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}\ra</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This implies
          <me>
            -2cx = \frac{dx}{dt}  \text{ and }    -4cy =\frac{dy}{dt}, \text{i.e.,}
          </me>
          <me>
            c = -\frac{1}{2x}\frac{dx}{dt}  \text{ and }    c =-\frac{1}{4y}\frac{dy}{dt}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As <m>c</m> equals both expressions, we have
          <me>
            \frac{1}{2x}\frac{dx}{dt} =\frac{1}{4y}\frac{dy}{dt}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To find an explicit relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
          we can integrate both sides with respect to <m>t</m>.
          Recall from our study of differentials that <m>\frac{dx}{dt}dt = dx</m>.
          Thus:
          <md>
            <mrow>\int \frac{1}{2x}\frac{dx}{dt}\,dt \amp =\int \frac{1}{4y}\frac{dy}{dt}\,dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\int \frac{1}{2x}\,dx \amp =\int\frac{1}{4y}\,dy</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac 12\ln\abs{x} \amp = \frac14\ln\abs{y} +C_1</mrow>
            <mrow>2\ln\abs{x} \amp = \ln\abs{y} +C_1</mrow>
            <mrow>\ln\abs{x^2} \amp = \ln\abs{y}+C_1</mrow>
            <intertext>Now raise both sides as a power of <m>e</m>:</intertext>
            <mrow>x^2 \amp = e^{\ln\abs{y}+C_1}</mrow>
            <mrow>x^2 \amp = e^{\ln\abs{y}}e^{C_1}\qquad \text{(Note that \(e^{C_1}\) is just a constant.)}</mrow>

            <mrow>Cx^2 \amp = y</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the water started at the point <m>(1,1/4)</m>,
          we can solve for <m>C</m>:
          <me>
            C(1)^2 = \frac14  \Rightarrow  C = \frac14

            <mrow>\nabla I \amp = \la \frac{-2x}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^2},\frac{-2y}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^2},\frac{-2z}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^2}\ra</mrow>
            <mrow>\nabla I(2,5,3) \amp = \la \frac{-4}{1444},\frac{-10}{1444},\frac{-6}{1444}\ra \approx \la -0.003,-0.007,-0.004\ra</mrow>
            <mrow>D_{\vec u\,}I \amp = \nabla I(2,5,3)\cdot \vec u</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = -\frac{17}{2166} \approx -0.0078</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The directional derivative tells us that moving in the direction of <m>\vec u</m> from <m>P</m> results in a decrease in intensity of about <m>-0.008</m> units per inch.
          (The intensity is decreasing as <m>\vec u</m> moves one farther from the origin than <m>P</m>.)
        </p>

        <p>
          The gradient gives the direction of greatest intensity increase.
          Notice that
          <md>
            <mrow>\nabla I(2,5,3) \amp = \la \frac{-4}{1444},\frac{-10}{1444},\frac{-6}{1444}\ra</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{2}{1444}\la -2,-5,-3\ra</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is, the gradient at <m>(2,5,3)</m> is pointing in the direction of <m>\la -2,-5,-3\ra</m>,
          that is, towards the origin.
          That should make intuitive sense:
          the greatest increase in intensity is found by moving towards to source of the energy.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      The directional derivative allows us to find the instantaneous rate of <m>z</m> change in any direction at a point.
      We can use these instantaneous rates of change to define lines and planes that are
      <em>tangent</em> to a surface at a point,
      which is the topic of the next section.
