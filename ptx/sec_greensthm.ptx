    <title>Flow and Flux</title>
    <p>
      Line integrals over vector fields have the natural interpretation of computing work when <m>\vec F</m> represents a force field.
      It is also common to use vector fields to represent velocities.
      In these cases, the line integral
      <m>\int_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r</m> is said to represent <em>flow</em>.

    <p>
      Let the vector field <m>\vec F = \la 1,0\ra</m> represent the velocity of water as it moves across a smooth surface,
      depicted in <xref ref="fig_flowfluxintro">Figure</xref>.
      A line integral over <m>C</m> will compute
      <q>how much water is moving
      <em>along</em> the path <m>C</m>.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the figure,
      <q>all</q> of the water above <m>C_1</m> is moving along that curve,
      whereas <q>none</q> of the water above <m>C_2</m> is moving along that curve
      (the curve and the flow of water are at right angles to each other).
      Because <m>C_3</m> has nonzero horizontal and vertical components,
      <q>some</q> of the water above that curve is moving along the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      When <m>C</m> is a closed curve,
      we call flow <em>circulation</em>,
      represented by <m>\oint_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <q>opposite</q> of flow is <em>flux</em>,
      a measure of <q>how much water is moving
      <em>across</em> the path <m>C</m>.</q>
      If a curve represents a filter in flowing water,
      flux measures how much water will pass through the filter.
      Considering again <xref ref="fig_flowfluxintro">Figure</xref>,
      we see that a screen along <m>C_1</m> will not filter any water as no water passes across that curve.
      Because of the nature of this field,
      <m>C_2</m> and <m>C_3</m> each filter the same amount of water per second.
    </p>

    <p>
      The terms <q>flow</q> and <q>flux</q>
      are used apart from velocity fields, too.
      Flow is measured by <m>\int_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r</m>,
      which is the same as <m>\int_C \vec F\cdot\vec T\, ds</m> by <xref ref="def_line_integral2">Definition</xref>.
      That is, flow is a summation of the amount of <m>\vec F</m> that is
      <em>tangent</em> to the curve <m>C</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast,
      flux is a summation of the amount of <m>\vec F</m> that is <em>orthogonal</em>
      to the direction of travel.
      To capture this orthogonal amount of <m>\vec F</m>,
      we use <m>\int_C \vec F \cdot \vec n\, ds</m> to measure flux,
      where <m>\vec n</m> is a unit vector orthogonal to the curve <m>C</m>.
      (Later, we'll measure flux across surfaces, too.
      For example,
      in physics it is useful to measure the amount of a magnetic field that passes through a surface.)
    </p>

    <p>
      How is <m>\vec n</m> determined?
      We'll later see that if <m>C</m> is a closed curve,
      we'll want <m>\vec n</m> to point to the outside of the curve
      (measuring how much is <q>going out</q>).
      We'll also adopt the convention that closed curves should be traversed counterclockwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      (If <m>C</m> is a complicated closed curve,
      it can be difficult to determine what
      <q>counterclockwise</q> means.
      Consider <xref ref="fig_fluxcounterclockwise">Figure</xref>.
      Seeing the curve as a whole, we know which way
      <q>counterclockwise</q> is.
      If we zoom in on point <m>A</m>,
      one might incorrectly choose to traverse the path in the wrong direction.
      So we offer this definition:
      <em>a closed curve is being traversed counterclockwise if the outside is to the right of the path and the inside is to the left.</em>)
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_fluxcounterclockwise">
      <caption>Determining <q>counterclockwise</q> is not always simple without a good definition.</caption>
      <img src="figures/figfluxcounterclockwise"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      When a curve <m>C</m> is traversed counterclockwise by <m>\vrt = \la f(t),
      g(t)\ra</m>,
      we rotate <m>\vec T</m> clockwise 90<m>^\circ</m> to obtain <m>\vec n</m>:
      <me>
        \vec T = \frac{\la \fp(t),g'(t)\ra}{\norm{\vrp(t)}}  \Rightarrow  \vec n = \frac{\la g'(t),-\fp(t)\ra}{\norm{\vrp(t)}}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Letting <m>\vec F = \la M, N\ra</m>, we calculate flux as:
      <md>
        <mrow>\int_C \vec F\cdot \vec n\, ds \amp = \int_C \vec F\cdot \frac{\la g'(t),-\fp(t)\ra}{\norm{\vrp(t)}} \norm{\vrp(t)}\, dt</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \int_C \la M, N\ra \cdot \la g'(t),-\fp(t)\ra\, dt</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \int_C \Big(M\,g'(t) - N\,\fp(t)\Big)dt</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \int_C M\,g'(t)\, dt - \int_C N\,\fp(t)\, dt.</mrow>
        <intertext>As the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> components of <m>\vrt</m> are <m>f(t)</m> and <m>g(t)</m> respectively, the differentials of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are <m>dx = \fp(t)dt</m> and <m>dy=g'(t)dt</m>. We can then write the above integrals as:</intertext>
        <mrow>\amp = \int_C M\, dy - \int_C N\, dx.</mrow>
        <intertext>This is often written as one integral (not incorrectly, though somewhat confusingly, as this one integral has two <q><m>d</m> 's</q>):</intertext>
        <mrow>\amp =\int_CM\, dy -N\, dx</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We summarize the above in the following definition.

    <p>
      This definition of flow also holds for curves in space,
      though it does not make sense to measure
      <q>flux across a curve</q> in space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Measuring flow is essentially the same as finding work performed by a force as done in the previous examples.
      Therefore we practice finding only flux in the following example.

        <p>
          We begin by finding parametrizations of <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m>.
          As done in <xref ref="ex_livf3">Example</xref>,
          parametrize <m>C_1</m> by creating the line that starts at <m>(1,0)</m> and moves in the <m>\la -1,1\ra</m> direction:
          <m>\vec r_1(t) = \la 1,0\ra + t\la -1,1\ra = \la 1-t, t\ra</m>,
          for <m>0\leq t\leq 1</m>.
          We parametrize <m>C_2</m> with the familiar
          <m>\vec r_2(t) = \la \cos t,\sin t\ra</m> on <m>0\leq t\leq \pi/2</m>.
          For reference later, we give each function and its derivative below:
          <me>
            \vec r_1(t) = \la 1-t, t\ra,  \vrp_1(t) = \la -1,1\ra
          </me>.
          <me>
            \vec r_2(t) = \la \cos t, \sin t\ra,  \vrp_2(t) = \la -\sin t ,\cos t\ra
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When <m>\vec F = \vec F_1 = \la y, -x+1\ra</m> (as shown in <xref ref="fig_flux1">Figure</xref>(a)),
          over <m>C_1</m> we have <m>M = y =t</m> and <m>N = -x+1 = -(1-t)+1 = t</m>.
          Using <xref ref="def_flowflux">Definition</xref>, we compute the flux:
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_{C_1} \vec F\cdot \vec n\, ds \amp  = \int_{C_1} \Big(M\,g'(t) - N\,\fp(t)\Big)\, dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^1 \Big( t(1) - t(-1)\Big)\, dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^1 2t\, dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 1</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over <m>C_2</m>,
          we have <m>M = y = \sin t</m> and <m>N = -x+1 = 1-\cos t</m>.
          Thus the flux across <m>C_2</m> is:
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_{C_1} \vec F\cdot \vec n\, ds \amp  = \int_{C_1} \Big(M\,g'(t) - N\,\fp(t)\Big)\, dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^{\pi/2}\Big((\sin t)(\cos t) - (1-\cos t)(-\sin t)\Big)\, dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin t\, dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =1</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice how the flux was the same across both curves.
          This won't hold true when we change the vector field.
        </p>

        <p>
          When <m>\vec F = \vec F_2 = \la -x,2y-x\ra</m> (as shown in <xref ref="fig_flux1">Figure</xref>(b)),
          over <m>C_1</m> we have <m>M = -x = t-1</m> and <m>N = 2y-x = 2t-(1-t) = 3t-1</m>.
          Computing the flux across <m>C_1</m>:

            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^1 \Big( (t-1)(1) - (3t-1)(-1)\Big)\, dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^1 (4t-2)\, dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 0</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over <m>C_2</m>,
          we have <m>M = -x = -\cos t</m> and <m>N = 2y-x = 2\sin t-\cos t</m>.
          Thus the flux across <m>C_2</m> is:
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_{C_1} \vec F\cdot \vec n\, ds \amp  = \int_{C_1} \Big(M\,g'(t) - N\,\fp(t)\Big)\, dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^{\pi/2}\Big((-\cos t)(\cos t) - (2\sin t-\cos t)(-\sin t)\Big)\, dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_0^{\pi/2} \big(2\sin^2 t-\sin t\cos t-\cos^2t\big)\, dt</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\pi/4 - 1/2\approx 0.285</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We analyze the results of this example below.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="ex_flux1">Example</xref>,
      we saw that the flux across the two curves was the same when the vector field was <m>\vec F_1 = \la y, -x+1\ra</m>.
      This is not a coincidence.
      We show why they are equal in <xref ref="ex_div2">Example</xref>.
      In short, the reason is this:
      the divergence of <m>\vec F_1</m> is 0, and when <m>\divv \vec F = 0</m>,
      the flux across any two paths with common beginning and ending points will be the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also saw in the example that the flux across <m>C_1</m> was 0 when the field was <m>\vec F_2 = \la -x, 2y-x\ra</m>.
      Flux measures <q>how much</q> of the field crosses the path from left to right
      (following the conventions established before).
      Positive flux means most of the field is crossing from left to right;
      negative flux means most of the field is crossing from right to left;
      zero flux means the same amount crosses from each side.
      When we consider <xref ref="fig_flux1">Figure</xref>(b),
      it seems plausible that the same amount of
      <m>\vec F_2</m> was crossing <m>C_1</m> from left to right as from right to left.

    <title>Green's Theorem</title>
    <p>
      There is an important connection between the circulation around a closed region <m>R</m> and the curl of the vector field inside of <m>R</m>,
      as well as a connection between the flux across the boundary of <m>R</m> and the divergence of the field inside <m>R</m>.
      These connections are described by Green's Theorem and the Divergence Theorem,
      respectively.

          The circulation around <m>C</m> is found by summing the flow along each of the sides of the triangle.
          We again leave it to the reader to confirm the following computations:
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_{C_1}\vec F\cdot d\vec r_1 \amp = \int_0^1 \la 0,(2t-1)^2+1\ra\cdot \la 2,0\ra dt = 0,</mrow>

            <mrow>\int_{C_3}\vec F\cdot d\vec r_3 \amp = \int_0^1 \la 2t-2,t^2+1\ra\cdot \la -1,-2\ra dt = -5/3</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The circulation is the sum of the flows: <m>2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We confirm Green's Theorem by computing <m>\iint_R \curl \vec F\, dA</m>.
          We find <m>\curl \vec F = 2x+1</m>.
          The region <m>R</m> is bounded by the lines <m>y = 2x+2</m>,
          <m>y=-2x+2</m> and <m>y=0</m>.
          Integrating with the order <m>dx\, dy</m> is most straightforward,
          leading to
          <me>
            \int_0^2\int_{y/2-1}^{1-y/2} (2x+1)\, dx\, dy = \int_0^2 (2-y)\, dy = 2

          Computing the circulation directly using the line integral looks difficult,
          as the integrand will include terms like
          <q><m>\sin\big(2\cos t + \frac1{10}\cos(10t)\big)</m>.</q>
        </p>

        <p>
          Green's Theorem states that <m>\oint_C\vec F\cdot d\vec r = \iint_R \curl\vec F\, dA</m>;
          since <m>\curl \vec F = 0</m> in this example,
          the double integral is simply 0 and hence the circulation is 0.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since <m>\curl \vec F = 0</m>,
          we can conclude that the circulation is 0 in two ways.
          One method is to employ Green's Theorem as done above.
          The second way is to recognize that <m>\vec F</m> is a conservative field,
          hence there is a function <m>z=f(x,y)</m> wherein <m>\vec F = \nabla f</m>.
          Let <m>A</m> be any point on the curve <m>C</m>;
          since <m>C</m> is closed,
          we can say that <m>C</m> <q>begins</q>
          and <q>ends</q> at <m>A</m>.
          By the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals,
          <m>\oint_C \vec F\, d\vec r = f(A)-f(A) = 0</m>.

    <p>
      One can use Green's Theorem to find the area of an enclosed region by integrating along its boundary.
      Let <m>C</m> be a closed curve,
      enclosing the region <m>R</m>,
      parametrized by <m>\vec r(t) = \la f(t),g(t)\ra</m>.
      We know the area of <m>R</m> is computed by the double integral <m>\iint_R \, dA</m>,
      where the integrand is <m>1</m>.
      By creating a field <m>\vec F</m> where <m>\curl \vec F =1</m>,
      we can employ Green's Theorem to compute the area of <m>R</m> as <m>\oint_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r</m>.

    <p>
      One is free to choose any field <m>\vec F</m> to use as long as <m>\curl\vec F = 1</m>.
      Common choices are <m>\vec F = \la 0,x\ra</m>,
      <m>\vec F = \la -y,0\ra</m> and <m>\vec F = \la -y/2,x/2\ra</m>.
      We demonstrate this below.

      In this section, we have investigated flow and flux,
      quantities that measure interactions between a vector field and a planar curve.
      We can also measure flow along spatial curves,
      though as mentioned before,
      it does not make sense to measure flux across spatial curves.
    </p>

    <p>
      It does, however,
      make sense to measure the amount of a vector field that passes across a surface in space <mdash /> i.e, the flux across a surface.
      We will study this,
      though in the next section we first learn about a more powerful way to describe surfaces than using functions of the form <m>z=f(x,y)</m>.
