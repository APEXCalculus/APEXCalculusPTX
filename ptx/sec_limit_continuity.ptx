  <title>Continuity</title>

  <p>
    As we have studied limits,
    we have gained the intuition that limits measure
    <q>where a function is heading.</q> That is,
    if <m>\lim\limits_{x\to 1} f(x) = 3</m>,
    then as <m>x</m> is close to <m>1</m>,
    <m>f(x)</m> is close to <m>3</m>.
    We have seen, though,
    that this is not necessarily a good indicator of what <m>f(1)</m> actually is.
    This can be problematic;
    functions can tend to one value but attain another.
    This section focuses on functions that
    <em>do not</em> exhibit such behavior.

    Note that in <xref ref="def_continuous"/>,

    A useful way to establish whether or not a function <m>f</m>

              The limits <m>\lim\limits_{x\to c} f(x)</m>
              do not exist at the jumps from one <q>step</q> to the next,

              Therefore the limits exist for all <m>c</m> except when

      </p>

      <p>
        We conclude that <m>f</m> is continuous everywhere except at integer values of <m>c</m>.
        So the intervals on which <m>f</m> is continuous are
        <me>
          \ldots, (-2,-1), (-1,0), (0,1), (1,2), \ldots
        </me>.
        We could also say that <m>f</m> is continuous on all intervals of the form
        <m>(n,n+1)</m> where <m>n</m> is an integer.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Our definition of continuity on an interval specifies the interval is an open interval.
    We can extend the definition of continuity to closed intervals of the form <m>[a,b]</m>
    by considering the appropriate one-sided limits at the endpoints.
  </p>

  <aside>
    <p>
      In this text, when we use the term <q>closed interval</q>,
      we mean an interval of the form <m>[a,b]</m>,
      where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers.
      One may be surprised to learn that intervals of the form <m>[a,\infty)</m>,
      <m>(-\infty, b]</m> and even <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> are all also considered closed in advanced calculus.
      While the mathematics supported by this definition of closed is
      fascinating and important, it is beyond the scope of our purposes here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some results, such as <xref ref="thm_extreme_val" text="title"/>,
      are valid for intervals of the form <m>[a,b]</m>,
      but not for intervals such as <m>[a,\infty)</m>.
      The latter interval is closed, but not <term>bounded</term>.

      <idx><h>bounded</h><h>interval</h></idx>

    <p>
      A set of real numbers is bounded if there is a number that is greater than every element in the set
      (an upper bound), and a number that is less than every element in the set (a lower bound).
      When we do calculus in higher dimensions, we can no longer talk about intervals,
      but we can still talk about sets being closed and bounded.
      See <xref ref="sec_multi_extreme_values"/> for details.

  <p>
    We can make the appropriate adjustments to talk about continuity on half-open intervals such as
    <m>[a,b)</m> or <m>(a,b]</m> if necessary.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the domain of <m>f</m> includes values less than <m>a</m>,
    we say that <xref ref="def_right_continuity">Item</xref> in <xref ref="def_closed_continuity"/>
    indicates that <m>f</m> is <term>continuous from the right</term> at <m>a</m>.
    But if <m>f</m> is undefined for <m>x\lt a</m>,
    we can say that <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>a</m> without ambiguity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, <xref ref="def_left_continuity">Item</xref> indcates that <m>f</m>
    is <term>continuous from the left</term> at <m>b</m>,
    and if <m>f</m> is not defined for <m>x\gt b</m>,
    we can simply say that <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>b</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, it makes sense to say that the function <m>f(x)=\sqrt{1-x^2}</m>
    is continuous at <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>,
    while the floor function in <xref ref="ex_contint2"/> is continuous from the left at <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>,
    but is not continuous at these points.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using this new definition,
    we can adjust our answer in <xref ref="ex_contint1">Example</xref>
    by stating that <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[0,1)</m> and <m>(1,3]</m>,
    as mentioned in that example.
    We can also revisit <xref ref="ex_contint2">Example</xref>
    and state that the floor function is continuous on the following half-open intervals
    <me>
      \ldots, [-2,-1), [-1,0), [0,1), [1,2), \ldots
    </me>.
  </p>

    <caption>Two continuity examples</caption>
    <video youtube="8z07z3yeChY" label="vid_limit_con_basic_ex"/>
  </figure>

  <p>
    This can tempt us to conclude that <m>f</m> is continuous everywhere;
    after all, if <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[0,1)</m> and <m>[1,2)</m>,
    isn't <m>f</m> also continuous on <m>[0,2)</m>?
    Of course, the answer is <em>no</em>,
    and the graph of the floor function immediately confirms this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Continuous functions are important as they behave in a predictable fashion:
    functions attain the value they approach.
    Because continuity is so important,
    most of the functions you have likely seen in the past are continuous on their domains.
    This is demonstrated in the following example where we examine the intervals of continuity of a variety of common functions.

              We cannot assume this implies that <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>;
              we need to check that <m>\lim\limits_{x\to 0}f(x) = f(0)</m>,

              It is easy to verify that this is indeed true,

    Continuity is inherently tied to the properties of limits.
    Because of this,
    the properties of limits found in <xref ref="thm_limit_algebra">Theorems</xref>
    and <xref ref="thm_poly_rat"/> apply to continuity as well.
    Further, now knowing the definition of continuity we can re-read
    <xref ref="thm_lim_continuous">Theorem</xref>
    as giving a list of functions that are continuous on their domains.
    The following theorem states how continuous functions can be combined to form other continuous functions,
    followed by a theorem which formally lists functions that we know are continuous on their domains.

      We have defined what it means for a function to be continuous on an interval,
      but many functions, such as <m>f(x)=\tan(x)</m>,
      have domains that are the union of more than one interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the domain of a function is a union of intervals, saying that a function is continuous on its domain
      means that the function is continuous on each of those intervals.
      But be careful to note that the converse is not true.
      As we learned in <xref ref="ex_contint2"/>,
      a function can be continuous on a collection of intervals, but not on their union.

    <title>Classification of discontinuities</title>
    <p>
      We now know what it means for a function to be continuous,
      so of course we can easily say what it means for a function to be <em>discontinuous</em>;
      namely, not continuous.
      However, to better understand continuity,
      it is worth our time to discuss the different ways in which a function can fail to be discontinuous.
      By definition, a function <m>f</m> is continuous at a point
      <m>a</m> in its domain if <m>\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)</m>.
      If this equality fails to hold, then <m>f</m> is not continuous.
      We note, however, that there are a number of different things that can go wrong with this equality.

            <m>\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=L</m> exists,
            but <m>L\neq f(a)</m>, or <m>f(a)</m> is undefined.
            Such a discontinuity is called a
            <term>removable discontinuity</term>
            <idx><h>discontinuity</h><h>removable</h></idx>.
          </p>

          <p>
            A removable discontinuity can be pictured as a
            <q>hole</q> in the graph of <m>f</m>.
            The term <q>removable</q> refers to the fact that
            by simply redefining <m>f(a)</m> to equal <m>L</m>
            (that is, changing the value of <m>f</m> at a single
            point), we can create a new function that is
            continuous at <m>x=a</m>, and agrees with <m>f</m>
            at all <m>x\neq a</m>.

            <m>\lim\limits_{x\to a^+}f(x) = L</m> and
            <m>\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}f(x)=M</m> exist,
            but <m>L\neq M</m>.
            In this case the left and right hand limits both exist,
            but since they are not equal, the limit of <m>f</m> as
            <m>x\to a</m> does not exist.
            Such a discontinuity is called a
            <term>jump discontinuity</term>.

            The phrase <q>jump discontinuity</q> is meant to

            to another as we cross the value <m>x=a</m>.

          <p>
            The function <m>f</m> is <em>unbounded</em>
            near <m>x=a</m>. This means that the value of
            <m>f</m> becomes arbitrarily large (or large and
            negative) as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>.

    <title>Consequences of continuity</title>
    <p>
      A common way of thinking of a continuous function is that
      <q>its graph can be sketched without lifting your pencil.</q> That is,
      its graph forms a <q>continuous</q> curve,
      without holes, breaks or jumps.
      This pseudo-definition glosses over some of the finer points of continuity.
      There are some very strange continuous functions that one would be hard pressed to actually sketch by hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, this intuitive notion of continuity does help us understand another important concept as follows.
      Suppose <m>f</m> is defined on <m>[1,2]</m>, and <m>f(1) = -10</m> and <m>f(2) = 5</m>.
      If <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[1,2]</m> (<ie/>, its graph can be sketched as a continuous curve
      from <m>(1,-10)</m> to <m>(2,5)</m>) then we know intuitively that somewhere on the interval <m>[1,2]</m>
      <m>f</m> must be equal to <m>-9</m>, and <m>-8</m>, and <m>-7,-6,\ldots,0,1/2</m>, etc.
      In short, <m>f</m> takes on all <em>intermediate</em>
      values between <m>-10</m> and <m>5</m>.
      It may take on more values;
      <m>f</m> may actually equal <m>6</m> at some time, for instance,
      but we are guaranteed all values between <m>-10</m> and <m>5</m>.
    </p>

      <caption>Illustration of the Intermediate Value Theorem: the output <m>3</m> is in between <m>-10</m> and <m>5</m>,
      and therefore any continuous function on <m>[1,2]</m> with <m>f(1) = -10</m> and <m>f(2) = 5</m>
      will achieve the output <m>3</m> somewhere in <m>[1,2]</m></caption>

      While this notion seems intuitive,
      it is not trivial to prove and its importance is profound.
      Therefore the concept is stated in the form of a theorem.

          Then for every value <m>y</m>,
          where <m>f(a) \lt y \lt f(b)</m>,

    <p>
      One important application of the <xref ref="thm_IVT" text="title"/> is root finding.
      Given a function <m>f</m>,
      we are often interested in finding values of <m>x</m> where <m>f(x) = 0</m>.
      These roots may be very difficult to find exactly.
      Good approximations can be found through successive applications of this theorem.
      Suppose through direct computation we find that
      <m>f(a) \lt 0</m> and <m>f(b)\gt 0</m>, where <m>a\lt b</m>.
      The <xref ref="thm_IVT" text="title"/> states that there is at least one <m>c</m> in <m>(a,b)</m> such that <m>f(c) = 0</m>.
      The theorem does not give us any clue as to where to find such a value in the interval <m>(a,b)</m>,
      just that at least one such value exists.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a technique that produces a good approximation of <m>c</m>.
      Let <m>d</m> be the midpoint of the interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      with <m>f(a) \lt 0</m> and
      <m>f(b) \gt 0</m> and consider <m>f(d)</m>.
      There are three possibilities:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(d) = 0</m>: We got lucky and stumbled on the actual value.
            We stop as we found a root.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(d) \lt 0</m>: Then we know there is a root of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[d,b]</m> <mdash/> we have halved the size of our interval,
            hence are closer to a good approximation of the root.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(d) \gt 0</m>: Then we know there is a root of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,d]</m> <mdash/> again,we have halved the size of our interval,
            hence are closer to a good approximation of the root.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Successively applying this technique is called the
      <term>Bisection Method</term>

          <idx><h>Bisection Method</h></idx>

      of root finding.
      We continue until the interval is sufficiently small.
      We demonstrate this in the following example.

        <p>
          Notice that in the 12th iteration we have the endpoints of the interval each starting with <m>0.739</m>.
          Thus we have narrowed the zero down to an accuracy of the first three places after the decimal.
          Using a computer, we have
          <me>
            f(0.7390) = -0.00014,  f(0.7391) = 0.000024
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Either endpoint of the interval gives a good approximation of where <m>f</m> is <m>0</m>.
          The <xref ref="thm_IVT"/> states that the actual zero is still within this interval.
          While we do not know its exact value,
          we know it starts with <m>0.739</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This type of exercise is rarely done by hand.
          Rather, it is simple to program a computer to run such an algorithm and stop when the endpoints differ by a preset small amount.
          One of the authors did write such a program and found the zero of <m>f</m> to be
          <m>0.7390851332</m> , accurate to <m>10</m> places after the decimal.
          While it took a few minutes to write the program,
          it took less than a thousandth of a second for the program to run the necessary <m>35</m> iterations.
          In less than <m>8</m> hundredths of a second,
          the zero was calculated to <m>100</m> decimal places
          (with less than <m>200</m> iterations).
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <!--TODO: Is the above a place to demonstrate an algorithm like this in Sage? -->

    <p>
      It is a simple matter to extend the Bisection Method to solve problems similar to <q>Find <m>x</m>,
      where <m>f(x) = 0</m>.</q> For instance,
      we can find <m>x</m>, where <m>f(x) = 1</m>.
      It actually works very well to define a new function <m>g</m> where <m>g(x) = f(x) - 1</m>.
      Then use the Bisection Method to solve <m>g(x)=0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, given two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>,
      we can use the Bisection Method to solve <m>f(x) = g(x)</m>.
      Once again, create a new function <m>h</m> where
      <m>h(x) = f(x)-g(x)</m> and solve <m>h(x) = 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_newton">Section</xref>
      another equation solving method will be introduced, called Newton's Method.
      In many cases, Newton's Method is much faster.
      It relies on more advanced mathematics, though,
      so we will wait before introducing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      This section formally defined what it means to be a continuous function.
      <q>Most</q> functions that we deal with are continuous,
      so often it feels odd to have to formally define this concept.
      Regardless, it is important, and forms the basis of the next chapter.
