  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_antider"/>,
      we were introduced to the idea of a differential equation.
      Given a function <m>y = f(x)</m>,
      we defined a <em>differential equation</em>
      as an equation involving <m>y,
      x</m>, and derivatives of <m>y</m>.
      We explored the simple differential equation <m>\yp = 2x</m>,
      and saw that a <em>solution</em>
      to a differential equation is simply a function that satisfies the differential equation.

      Let us return to the simple differential equation
      <me>
        \yp = 2x
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find a solution,
      we must find a function whose derivative is <m>2x</m>.
      In other words, we seek an antiderivative of <m>2x</m>.
      The function
      <me>
        y = x^2
      </me>
      is an antiderivative of <m>2x</m>,
      and solves the differential equation.
      So do the functions
      <me>
        y = x^2 + 1
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        y = x^2 - 2346
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We call the function
      <me>
        y = x^2 +  C
      </me>,
      with <m>C</m> an arbitrary constant of integration,
      the <em>general solution</em> to the differential equation.

      <idx><h>differential equation</h><h>general solution</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to specify the value of the integration constant <m>C</m>,
      we require additional information.
      For example, if we know that <m>y(1) = 3</m>,
      it follows that <m>C=2</m>.
      This additional information is called an
      <em>initial condition.</em>

          A differential equation paired with an initial condition

        <em>Note:</em>
        A general solution typically includes one or more arbitrary constants.
        Different values of the constant(s) specify different members in the family of solutions.
        The particular solution to an initial value problem is the specific member in the family of solutions that corresponds to the given initial condition(s).

      <title>A simple first-order differential equation</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve the differential equation <m>\yp = 2y</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The solution is a function <m>y</m> such that differentiation yields twice the original function.
          Unlike our starting example,
          finding the solution here does not involve computing an antiderivative.
          Notice that
          <q>integrating both sides</q>
          would yield the result <m>y = \int 2y\,dx</m>, which is not useful.
          Without knowledge of the function <m>y</m>,
          we can't compute the indefinite integral.
          Later sections will explore systematic ways to find analytic solutions to simple differential equations.
          For now, a bit of thought might let us guess the solution
          <me>
            y = e^{2x}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that application of the chain rule yields <m>\yp = 2e^{2x} = 2y</m>.
          Another solution is given by
          <me>
            y = -3e^{2x}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact,
          <me>
            y = Ce^{2x}
          </me>,
          where <m>C</m> is any constant,
          is the <em>general solution</em>
          to the differential equation because <m>\yp = 2Ce^{2x} = 2y</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we are provided with a single initial condition,
          say <m>y(0) = 3/2</m>, we can identify <m>C=3/2</m> so that
          <me>
            y = \frac{3}{2}e^{2x}
          </me>
          is the <em>particular solution</em>
          to the initial value problem

          Each <m>C</m> value yields a different member of the family,

          We emphasize the particular solution corresponding to the initial condition <m>y(0)=3/2</m>.

    <title>Graphical Solutions to Differential Equations</title>
    <p>
      In the examples we have explored so far,
      we have found exact forms for the functions that solve the differential equations.
      Solutions of this type are called
      <em>analytic solutions.</em>
      Many times a differential equation has a solution,
      but it is difficult or impossible to find the solution analytically.
      This is analogous to algebraic equations.
      The algebraic equation <m>x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0</m> has two real solutions that can be found analytically by using the quadratic formula.
      The equation <m>\cos(x) = x</m> has one real solution,
      but we can't find it analytically.
      As shown in <xref ref="fig_20_01_intersection"/>,
      we can find an approximate solution graphically by plotting <m>\cos(x)</m> and <m>x</m> and observing the <m>x</m>-value of the intersection.
      We can similarly use graphical tools to understand the qualitative behavior of solutions to a first order-differential equation.

      Consider the first-order differential equation
      <me>
        \yp = f(x,y)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function <m>f</m> could be any function of the two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      Written in this way,
      we can think of the function <m>f</m> as providing a formula to find the slope of a solution at a given point in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
      In other words,
      suppose a solution to the differential equation passes through the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.
      At the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>,
      the slope of the solution curve will be <m>f(x_0,y_0)</m>.
      Since this calculation of the slope is possible at any point <m>(x,y)</m> where the function <m>f(x,y)</m> is defined,
      we can produce a plot called a <em>slope field</em>
      (or direction field)
      that shows the slope of a solution at any point in the <m>xy</m>-plane where the solution is defined.
      Further, this process can be done purely by working with the differential equation itself.
      In other words,
      we can draw a slope field and use it to determine the qualitative behavior of solutions to a differential equation without having to solve the differential equation.

          We also often restrict attention to non-negative <m>y</m>-values because negative values correspond to a negative population.

    <title>Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations: Euler's Method</title>
    <p>
      While the slope field is an effective way to understand the qualitative behavior of solutions to a differential equation,
      it is difficult to use a slope field to make quantitative predictions.
      For example,
      if we have the slope field for the differential equation
      <m>\yp = x+y</m> from <xref ref="ex_slope_field"/>
      along with the initial condition <m>y(0)=1</m>,
      we can understand the qualitative behavior of the solution to the initial value problem,
      but will struggle to predict a specific value,
      <m>y(2)</m> for example, with any degree of confidence.
      The most straightforward way to predict <m>y(2)</m> is to find the analytic solution to the the initial value problem and evaluate it at <m>x=2</m>.
      Unfortunately,
      we have already mentioned that it is impossible to find analytic solutions to many differential equations.
      In the absence of an analytic solution,
      a <em>numerical solution</em> can serve as an effective tool to make quantitative predictions about the solution to an initial value problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many techniques for computing numerical solutions to initial value problems.
      A course in numerical analysis will discuss various techniques along with their strengths and weaknesses.
      The simplest technique is called
      <em>Euler's Method</em>.

        Euler's Method is named for Leonhard Euler,
        a prolific Swiss mathematician during the 1700's.

      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the definition of the derivative,
      <me>
        \yp(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{y(x+h) - y(x)}{h}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This notation can be confusing at first, but
      <q><m>y(x)</m></q>
      simply means
      <q>the <m>y</m>-value of the solution when the <m>x</m>-value is <m>x</m></q>, and
      <q><m>y(x+h)</m></q>
      means
      <q>the <m>y</m>-value of the solution when the <m>x</m>-value is <m>x+h</m></q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we remove the limit but restrict <m>h</m> to be
      <q>small,</q>
      we have
      <me>
        \yp(x) \approx \frac{y(x+h) - y(x)}{h}

      so that
      <me>
        f(x,y) \approx \frac{y(x+h)-y(x)}{h}
      </me>,
      because <m>\yp = f(x,y)</m> according to the differential equation.
      Rearranging terms,
      <me>
        y(x + h) \approx y(x) + h\,f(x,y)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This statement says that if we know the solution (<m>y</m>-value) to the initial value problem for some given <m>x</m>-value,
      we can find an approximation for the solution at the value <m>x+h</m> by taking our <m>y</m>-value and adding <m>h</m> times the function <m>f</m> evaluated at the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values.
      Euler's method uses the initial condition of an initial value problem as the starting point,
      and then uses the above idea to find approximate values for the solution <m>y</m> at later <m>x</m>-values.
      The algorithm is summarized in <xref ref="idea_Euler"/>.

    <p>
      Using the results from <xref ref="ex_euler1" text="global">Examples</xref>
      and <xref ref="ex_euler2" text="global"/>,
      we can make a few observations about Euler's method.
      First, the Euler approximation generally gets worse as we get farther from the initial condition.
      This is because Euler's method involves two sources of error.
      The first comes from the fact that we're using a positive <m>h</m>-value in the derivative approximation instead of using a limit as <m>h</m> approaches zero.
      Essentially,
      we're using a linear approximation to the solution <m>y</m>
      (similar to the process described in <xref ref="sec_differentials"/> on Differentials.)
      This error is often called the <em>local truncation error.</em>
      The second source of error comes from the fact that every step in Euler's method uses the result of the previous step.
      That means we're using an approximate <m>y</m>-value to approximate the next <m>y</m>-value.
      Doing this repeatedly causes the errors to build on each other.
      This second type of error is often called the <em>propagated</em>
      or <em>accumulated error.</em>

    </p>
    <p>
      A second observation is that the Euler approximation is more accurate for smaller <m>h</m>-values.
      This accuracy comes at a cost, though.
      <xref ref="ex_euler2"/>
      is more accurate than <xref ref="ex_euler1"/>,
      but takes twice as many computations.
      In general, numerical algorithms
      (even when performed by a computer program)
      require striking a balance between a desired level of accuracy and the amount of computational effort we are willing to undertake.

      Let's do one final example of Euler's Method.

      <title>Using Euler's Method 3</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find an approximation for the solution to the logistic differential equation

        <p>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The logistic differential equation is what is called an
          <em>autonomous equation</em>.
          An autonomous differential equation has no explicit dependence on the independent variable
          (<m>t</m> in this case).
          This has no real effect on the application of Euler's method other than the fact that the function <m>f(t,y)</m> is really just a function of <m>y</m>.
          To take steps in the <m>y</m> variable, we use
          <me>
            y_{i+1} = y_i + hf(t_i,y_i) = y_i + hy_i(1-y_i)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using <m>N=10</m> steps requires <m>\displaystyle h = \frac{4-0}{10} = 0.4</m>.

    <p>
      The study of differential equations is a natural extension of the study of derivatives and integrals.
      The equations themselves involve derivatives,
      and methods to find analytic solutions often involve finding antiderivatives.
      In this section,
      we focus on graphical and numerical techniques to understand solutions to differential equations.
      We restrict our examples to relatively simple initial value problems that permit analytic solutions to the equations,
      but we should remember that this is only for comparison purposes.
      In reality, many differential equations,
      even some that appear straightforward,
      do not have solutions we can find analytically.
      Even so, we can use the techniques presented in this section to understand the behavior of solutions.
      In the next two sections,
      we explore two techniques to find analytic solutions to two different classes of differential equations.

                  The <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes are uncalibrated. The field lines form concentric
                  ovals facing away from the origin on both positive and negative <m>x</m> and
                  <m>y</m> axes. The concentric shorter arcs are on either end of the <m>x</m> axis.
                  On the two ends of the <m>y</m> axis concentric wider arcs are drawn.
                  The field lines intermix to form an 'X' with centre at the origin.

                  The <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes are uncalibrated. There are five instances where
                  the field lines run parallel to the <m>x</m> axis. One of them is on the <m>x</m>
                  axis itself, other two pairs of such field lines are above and below the <m>x</m>
                  axis. In between the <m>x</m> axis and the first horizontal field line for some
                  positive <m>y</m> value, the field lines are all northeast facing. Above the
                  horizontal field line for some <m>y</m> value until another with a higher <m>y</m>
                  value, the field lines in between are southeast facing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similarly below the <m>x</m> axis till the first horizontal line with some negative
                  <m>y</m> value, the field lines in between are southeast facing. In between this
                  horizontal line and another horizontal line with a higher negative <m>y</m> value,
                  the field lines are northeast facing.

                quadrant are shown.
                Front left to right, a little away from the x axis the field lines are northeast
                facing that transition to north facing. Moving further right then again become
                northeast facing then transition to southeast facing, further right they become
                south facing then east facing. The pattern then repeats. Very close to the <m>x</m>
                axis the field lines are almost parallel to it.

                  A wave is drawn that starts at some y intercept above the origin. It has a high

                  to southeast facing, then it declines until the point the field lines are parallel
                  to the <m>x</m> axis. The curve continues to form a second wave.
