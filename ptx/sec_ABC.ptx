  <title>Area Between Curves</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We are often interested in knowing the area of a region.
      Forget momentarily that we addressed this already in <xref ref="sec_FTC">Section</xref>
      and approach it instead using the technique described in <xref ref="idea_app_of_defint">Key Idea</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>Q</m> be the area of a region bounded by continuous functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
      If we break the region into many subregions,
      we have an obvious equation:
    </p>

    <p>
      Total Area = sum of the areas of the subregions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The issue to address next is how to systematically break a region into subregions.
      A graph will help.
      Consider <xref ref="fig_abcintro">Figure</xref>
      (a) where a region between two curves is shaded.
      While there are many ways to break this into subregions,
      one particularly efficient way is to
      <q>slice</q> it vertically,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_abcintro">Figure</xref> (b),
      into <m>n</m> equally spaced slices.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now approximate the area of a slice.
      Again, we have many options, but using a rectangle seems simplest.
      Picking any <m>x</m>-value <m>c_i</m> in the <m>i</m>th slice,
      we set the height of the rectangle to be <m>f(c_i)-g(c_i)</m>,
      the difference of the corresponding <m>y</m>-values.
      The width of the rectangle is a small difference in <m>x</m>-values,
      which we represent with <m>\dx</m>.
      <xref ref="fig_abcintro">Figure</xref>
      (c) shows sample points <m>c_i</m> chosen in each subinterval and appropriate rectangles drawn.
      (Each of these rectangles represents a differential element.)
      Each slice has an area approximately equal to <m>\big(f(c_i)-g(c_i)\big)\dx</m>;
      hence, the total area is approximately the Riemann Sum
      <me>
        Q = \sum_{i=1}^n \big(f(c_i)-g(c_i)\big)\dx
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking the limit as <m>n\to \infty</m> gives the exact area as <m>\int_a^b \big(f(x)-g(x)\big)\, dx</m>.

        <p>
          A quick calculation shows that <m>f=g</m> at <m>x=1, 2</m> and 4.
          One can proceed thoughtlessly by computing <m>\ds \int_1^4\big(f(x)-g(x)\big)\, dx</m>,
          but this ignores the fact that on <m>[1,2]</m>, <m>g(x)>f(x)</m>.
          (In fact, the thoughtless integration returns <m>-9/4</m>,
          hardly the expected value of an <em>area</em>.)
          Thus we compute the total area by breaking the interval <m>[1,4]</m> into two subintervals,
          <m>[1,2]</m> and <m>[2,4]</m> and using the proper integrand in each.
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{ Total Area }  \amp = \int_1^2 \big(g(x)-f(x)\big)\, dx + \int_2^4\big(f(x)-g(x)\big)\, dx</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \int_1^2 \big(x^3-7x^2+14x-8\big) \, dx + \int_2^4\big(-x^3+7x^2-14x+8\big)\, dx</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 5/12 + 8/3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 37/12 = 3.083\ \text{ units } ^2</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      The previous example makes note that we are expecting area to be <em>positive</em>.
      When first learning about the definite integral,
      we interpreted it as <q>signed area under the curve,</q>
      allowing for <q>negative area.</q> That doesn't apply here;
      area is to be positive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The previous example also demonstrates that we often have to break a given region into subregions before applying <xref ref="thm_areabetweencurves">Theorem</xref>.
      The following example shows another situation where this is applicable,
      along with an alternate view of applying the Theorem.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_abc3">
      <title>Finding area: integrating with respect to $y$</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the area of the region enclosed by the functions <m>y=\sqrt{x}+2</m>,
          <m>y=-(x-1)^2+3</m> and <m>y=2</m>,
          as shown in <xref ref="fig_abc3">Figure</xref>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We give two approaches to this problem.
          In the first approach, we notice that the region's <q>top</q>
          is defined by two different curves.
          On <m>[0,1]</m>, the top function is <m>y=\sqrt{x}+2</m>;
          on <m>[1,2]</m>, the top function is <m>y=-(x-1)^2+3</m>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="fig_abc3">
          <caption>Graphing a region for <xref ref="ex_abc3">Example</xref>.</caption>
          <img src="figures/figabc3"/>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Thus we compute the area as the sum of two integrals:
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{ Total Area }  \amp = \int_0^1 \Big(\big(\sqrt{x}+2\big)-2\Big)\, dx + \int_1^2 \Big(\big(-(x-1)^2+3\big)-2\Big)\, dx</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 2/3 + 2/3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =4/3</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second approach is clever and very useful in certain situations.
          We are used to viewing curves as functions of <m>x</m>;
          we input an <m>x</m>-value and a <m>y</m>-value is returned.
          Some curves can also be described as functions of <m>y</m>:
          input a <m>y</m>-value and an <m>x</m>-value is returned.
          We can rewrite the equations describing the boundary by solving for <m>x</m>:
          <me>
            y=\sqrt{x}+2  \Rightarrow x=(y-2)^2
          </me>
          <me>
            y=-(x-1)^2+3  \Rightarrow  x=\sqrt{3-y}+1
          </me>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="fig_abc3b">
          <caption>The region used in <xref ref="ex_abc3">Example</xref> with boundaries relabeled as functions of <m>y</m>.</caption>
          <img src="figures/figabc3b"/>
        </figure>

        <p>
          <xref ref="fig_abc3b">Figure</xref>
          shows the region with the boundaries relabeled.
          A differential element, a horizontal rectangle, is also pictured.
          The width of the rectangle is a small change in <m>y</m>:
          <m>\Delta y</m>.
          The height of the rectangle is a difference in <m>x</m>-values.
          The <q>top</q> <m>x</m>-value is the largest value, i.e., the rightmost.
          The <q>bottom</q> <m>x</m>-value is the smaller, i.e., the leftmost.
          Therefore the height of the rectangle is
          <me>
            \big(\sqrt{3-y}+1\big) - (y-2)^2
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The area is found by integrating the above function with respect to <m>y</m> with the appropriate bounds.
          We determine these by considering the <m>y</m>-values the region occupies.
          It is bounded below by <m>y=2</m>,
          and bounded above by <m>y=3</m>.
          That is, both the <q>top</q> and <q>bottom</q>
          functions exist on the <m>y</m> interval <m>[2,3]</m>.
          Thus
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{ Total Area }  \amp = \int_2^3 \big(\sqrt{3-y}+1 - (y-2)^2\big)\, dy</mrow>

      This calculus<ndash />based technique of finding area can be useful even with shapes that we normally think of as <q>easy.</q>
      <xref ref="ex_abc4">Example</xref>
      computes the area of a triangle.
      While the formula <q><m>\frac12\times\text{ base } \times\text{ height }</m></q> is well known,
      in arbitrary triangles it can be nontrivial to compute the height.
      Calculus makes the problem simple.

          Recognize that there are two <q>top</q>

          causing us to use two definite integrals.

            <mrow>\text{ Total Area }  \amp = \int_1^2\big((x+1)-(-\frac12x+\frac52)\big)\, dx + \int_2^3\big((-2x+7)-(-\frac12x+\frac52)\big)\, dx</mrow>

        </figure>

        <p>
          We can also approach this by converting each function into a function of <m>y</m>.
          This also requires 2 integrals,
          so there isn't really any advantage to doing so.
          We do it here for demonstration purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <q>top</q> function is always <m>x=\frac{7-y}2</m> while there are two
          <q>bottom</q> functions.
          Being mindful of the proper integration bounds, we have
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{ Total Area }  \amp = \int_1^2\big(\frac{7-y}2 - (5-2y)\big)\, dy + \int_2^3\big(\frac{7-y}2-(y-1)\big)\, dy</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 3/4 + 3/4</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 3/2</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, the final answer is the same.
          (It is interesting to note that the area of all 4 subregions used is 3/4.
          This is coincidental.)
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      While we have focused on producing exact answers,
      we are also able to make approximations using the principle of <xref ref="thm_areabetweencurves">Theorem</xref>.
      The integrand in the theorem is a distance (<q>top minus bottom</q>);
      integrating this distance function gives an area.
      By taking discrete measurements of distance,
      we can approximate an area using numerical integration techniques developed in <xref ref="sec_numerical_integration">Section</xref>.
      The following example demonstrates this.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_abc5">
      <title>Numerically approximating area</title>
      <statement>
        <p>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The measurements of length can be viewed as measuring
          <q>top minus bottom</q> of two functions.
          The exact answer is found by integrating <m>\ds \int_0^{12} \big(f(x)-g(x)\big)\, dx</m>,
          but of course we don't know the functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
          Our discrete measurements instead allow us to approximate.

          one common answer is when the region has two or more
          <q>top</q> or <q>bottom</q>
          functions when viewing the region with respect to <m>x</m>,
          but has only 1 <q>top</q> function and 1 <q>bottom</q>
          function when viewed with respect to <m>y</m>.
          The former area requires multiple integrals to compute,
          whereas the latter area requires one.
