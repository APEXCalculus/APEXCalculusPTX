  <title>Area Between Curves</title>
  <p>
    We are often interested in knowing the area of a region.
    Forget momentarily that we addressed this already in <xref ref="sec_FTC"/>
    and approach it instead using the technique described in <xref ref="idea_app_of_defint"/>.

  </figure>

  <p>
    Let <m>Q</m> be the area of a region bounded by continuous functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
    If we break the region into many subregions,
    we have an obvious equation:
  </p>

  <p>
    Total Area = sum of the areas of the subregions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The issue to address next is how to systematically break a region into subregions.
    A graph will help.
    Consider <xref ref="fig_abcintroa"/>
    where a region between two curves is shaded.
    While there are many ways to break this into subregions,
    one particularly efficient way is to
    <q>slice</q> it vertically,
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_abcintrob"/>,
    into <m>n</m> equally spaced slices.
  </p>

  <p>
    We now approximate the area of a slice.
    Again, we have many options, but using a rectangle seems simplest.
    Picking any <m>x</m>-value <m>c_i</m> in the <m>i</m>th slice,
    we set the height of the rectangle to be <m>f(c_i)-g(c_i)</m>,
    the difference of the corresponding <m>y</m>-values.
    The width of the rectangle is a small difference in <m>x</m>-values,
    which we represent with <m>\dx</m>.
    <xref ref="fig_abcintroc"/>
    shows sample points <m>c_i</m> chosen in each subinterval and appropriate rectangles drawn.
    (Each of these rectangles represents a differential element.)
    Each slice has an area approximately equal to <m>\big(f(c_i)-g(c_i)\big)\dx</m>;
    hence, the total area is approximately the Riemann Sum
    <me>
      Q = \sum_{i=1}^n \big(f(c_i)-g(c_i)\big)\dx
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taking the limit as <m>n\to \infty</m> gives the exact area as <m>\int_a^b \big(f(x)-g(x)\big)\, dx</m>.
  </p>

              Graph of two functions <m> f(x) </m> and <m> g(x) </m> lying on the <m>xy</m> plane.
              The x-axis contains two marked points, a and b, which are both plotted on the positive x-axis.
              The functions <m> f(x) </m> and <m> g(x) </m> cross at the y-axis before diverging.
              The function <m> f(x) </m> lies above the function <m> g(x) </m> and resembles a sine wave.
              The function <m> g(x) </m> is a quadratic function which lies below <m> f(x) </m> on the interval <m>(a,b)</m>.
              The area lying between the marked points a and b and below <m> f(x) </m> and above <m> g(x) </m> is shaded, which gives the exact area of this region.

        hardly the expected value of an <em>area</em>.)
        Thus we compute the total area by breaking the interval <m>[1,4]</m> into two subintervals,

    The previous example makes note that we are expecting area to be <em>positive</em>.
    When first learning about the definite integral,
    we interpreted it as <q>signed area under the curve,</q>
    allowing for <q>negative area.</q> That doesn't apply here;
    area is to be positive.

  <p>
    The previous example also demonstrates that we often have to break a given region into subregions before applying <xref ref="thm_areabetweencurves"/>.
    The following example shows another situation where this is applicable,
    along with an alternate view of applying the Theorem.

        We give two approaches to this problem.
        In the first approach, we notice that the region's <q>top</q>
        is defined by two different curves.
        On <m>[0,1]</m>, the top function is <m>y=\sqrt{x}+2</m>;
        on <m>[1,2]</m>, the top function is <m>y=-(x-1)^2+3</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus we compute the area as the sum of two integrals:
        <md>
          <mrow>\text{Total Area}  \amp = \int_0^1 \Big(\big(\sqrt{x}+2\big)-2\Big)\, dx + \int_1^2 \Big(\big(-(x-1)^2+3\big)-2\Big)\, dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 2/3 + 2/3</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =4/3</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second approach is clever and very useful in certain situations.
        We are used to viewing curves as functions of <m>x</m>;
        we input an <m>x</m>-value and a <m>y</m>-value is returned.
        Some curves can also be described as functions of <m>y</m>:
        input a <m>y</m>-value and an <m>x</m>-value is returned.
        We can rewrite the equations describing the boundary by solving for <m>x</m>:
        <me>
          y=\sqrt{x}+2  \Rightarrow x=(y-2)^2
        </me>
        <me>
          y=-(x-1)^2+3  \Rightarrow  x=\sqrt{3-y}+1
        </me>.

    While we have focused on producing exact answers,
    we are also able to make approximations using the principle of <xref ref="thm_areabetweencurves"/>.
    The integrand in the theorem is a distance (<q>top minus bottom</q>);
    integrating this distance function gives an area.
    By taking discrete measurements of distance,
    we can approximate an area using numerical integration techniques developed in <xref ref="sec_numerical_integration"/>.
    The following example demonstrates this.

                  A graph of the previous sketch of a lake with vertically strenching length measurements.
                  The curve begins at the y-axis at the point <m>(0,3)</m>.
                  From this point, the curve slopes upwards until it reaches a peak near the point <m>(6,7)</m>.
                  After reaching a peak, the curve slopes downwards towards the point <m>(12,3)</m>.
                  From the point <m>(0,3)</m>, the downward portion of the curve reaches its minimum near <m>(7,1)</m>, after which it goes upwards to meet at the point <m>(12,3)</m>.

                <p>
                  There are 5 vertical length measurements given which occur at all even x starting at <m>x=2</m>.
                  The first vertical length measurement is 2.25.
                  The second is 5.08.
                  The third is 6.35.

                  The fifth is 2.76.
                  There is then an increment of length 2 on the x-axis between the last measurement occuring at <m>x=10</m>m, and the edge of the lake occuring at <m>x=12</m>.

      <p>
        The measurements of length can be viewed as measuring
        <q>top minus bottom</q> of two functions.
        The exact answer is found by integrating <m>\ds \int_0^{12} \big(f(x)-g(x)\big)\, dx</m>,
        but of course we don't know the functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
        Our discrete measurements instead allow us to approximate.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have the following data points:
        <me>
          (0,0),\,(2,2.25),\,(4,5.08),\,(6,6.35),\,(8,5.21),\,(10,2.76),\,(12,0)
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also have that <m>\dx=\frac{b-a}{n} = 2</m>, so Simpson's Rule gives
        <md>
          <mrow>\text{Area} \amp \approx \frac{2}{3}\Big(1\cdot0+4\cdot2.25+2\cdot5.08+4\cdot6.35+2\cdot5.21+4\cdot2.76+1\cdot0\Big)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 44.01\overline{3} \,\text{units}^2</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the measurements are in hundreds of feet,
        square units are given by (<quantity><mag>100</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity>)<m>^2 = </m><quantity><mag>10,000</mag><unit base="foot" exp="2"/></quantity>,
        giving a total area of <quantity><mag>440,133</mag><unit base="foot" exp="2"/></quantity>.
        (Since we are approximating,
        we'd likely say the area was about <quantity><mag>440,000</mag><unit base="foot" exp="2"/></quantity>,
        which is a little more than 10 acres.)

    In the next section we apply our applications of integration techniques to finding the volumes of certain solids.

              Answers may vary;
              one common answer is when the region has two or more

              functions when viewing the region with respect to <m>x</m>,

              function when viewed with respect to <m>y</m>.
              The former area requires multiple integrals to compute,
              whereas the latter area requires one.

                are measured in 100-foot increments.

                      A sketch of a lake with four vertically strenching length measurements measured with lengths in hundreds of feet.
                      Each length measurement is given in 100-foot increments from the previous measurement, starting 100 feet from the leftmost point of the lake.
                      The first vertical length measurement is 4.9.
                      The second is 5.2.
                      The third is 7.3.
                      The fourth is 4.5.
                      There is then a 100-foot distance from the last measurement to the end of the lake.
