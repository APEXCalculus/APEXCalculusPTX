  <title>Introduction to Cartesian Coordinates in Space</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Up to this point in this text we have considered mathematics in a 2-dimensional world.
      We have plotted graphs on the <m>xy</m>-plane using rectangular and polar coordinates and found the area of regions in the plane.
      We have considered properties of <em>solid</em> objects,
      such as volume and surface area,
      but only by first defining a curve in the plane and then rotating it out of the plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      While there is wonderful mathematics to explore in
      <q>2D,</q> we live in a <q>3D</q>
      world and eventually we will want to apply mathematics involving this third dimension.
      In this section we introduce Cartesian coordinates in space and explore basic surfaces.
      This will lay a foundation for much of what we do in the remainder of the text.

    <p>
      Each point <m>P</m> in space can be represented with an ordered triple,
      <m>P=(a,b,c)</m>, where <m>a</m>,
      <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> represent the relative position of <m>P</m> along the <m>x</m>-, <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-axes,
      respectively.
      Each axis is perpendicular to the other two.
    </p>

    <p>
      Visualizing points in space on paper can be problematic,
      as we are trying to represent a 3-dimensional concept on a 2-dimensional medium.
      We cannot draw three lines representing the three axes in which each line is perpendicular to the other two.
      Despite this issue,
      standard conventions exist for plotting shapes in space that we will discuss that are more than adequate.
    </p>

    <p>
      One convention is that the axes must conform to the
      <em>right hand rule</em>.
      This rule states that when the index finger of the right hand is extended in the direction of the positive <m>x</m>-axis,
      and the middle finger
      (bent <q>inward</q> so it is perpendicular to the palm)
      points along the positive <m>y</m>-axis,
      then the extended thumb will point in the direction of the positive <m>z</m>-axis. (It may take some thought to verify this,
      but this system is inherently different from the one created by using the
      <q>left hand rule.</q>)<idx><h>right hand rule</h><h>of Cartesian coordinates</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p>
      As long as the coordinate axes are positioned so that they follow this rule,
      it does not matter how the axes are drawn on paper.
      There are two popular methods that we briefly discuss.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="fig_cartcoord1"/>
      we see the point <m>P=(2,1,3)</m> plotted on a set of axes.
      The basic convention here is that the <m>xy</m>-plane is drawn in its standard way,
      with the <m>z</m>-axis down to the left.
      The perspective is that the paper represents the <m>xy</m>-plane and the positive <m>z</m> axis is coming up,
      off the page.
      This method is preferred by many engineers.
      Because it can be hard to tell where a single point lies in relation to all the axes,
      dashed lines have been added to let one see how far along each axis the point lies.
    </p>

    <p>
      One can also consider the <m>xy</m>-plane as being a horizontal plane in, say,
      a room, where the positive <m>z</m>-axis is pointing up.
      When one steps back and looks at this room,
      one might draw the axes as shown in <xref ref="fig_cartcoord2"/>.
      The same point <m>P</m> is drawn, again with dashed lines.
      This point of view is preferred by most mathematicians,
      and is the convention adopted by this text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes divide the plane into four <em>quadrants</em>,
      the <m>x</m>-, <m>y</m>-, and <m>z</m>-coordinate planes divide space into eight <em>octants</em>.
      The octant in which <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>,
      and <m>z</m> are positive is called the <em>first octant</em>.
      We do not name the other seven octants in this text.

    <title>Measuring Distances</title>
    <p>
      It is of critical importance to know how to measure distances between points in space.
      The formula for doing so is based on measuring distance in the plane,
      and is known
      (in both contexts)
      as the Euclidean measure of distance.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def_space_distance">
      <title>Distance In Space</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>P=(x_1,y_1,z_1)</m> and <m>Q = (x_2,y_2,z_2)</m> be points in space.
          The distance <m>D</m> between <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> is <idx><h>distance</h><h>between points in space</h></idx>
          <me>
            D = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      We refer to the line segment that connects points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> in space as <m>\overline{PQ}</m>,
      and refer to the length of this segment as <m>\norm{\overline{PQ}}</m>.
      The above distance formula allows us to compute the length of this segment.

          simply connect them with a straight line.
          One <em>cannot</em> actually measure this line on the page and deduce anything meaningful;
          its true length must be measured analytically.

    <title>Spheres</title>
    <p>
      Just as a circle is the set of all points in the <em>plane</em> equidistant from a given point (its center), a sphere is the set of all points in <em>space</em> that are equidistant from a given point.
      <xref ref="def_space_distance"/>
      allows us to write an equation of the sphere.
      <idx><h>sphere</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p>
      We start with a point <m>C = (a,b,c)</m> which is to be the center of a sphere with radius <m>r</m>.
      If a point <m>P=(x,y,z)</m> lies on the sphere,
      then <m>P</m> is <m>r</m> units from <m>C</m>; that is,
      <me>
        \norm{\overline{PC}} = \sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2} = r
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Squaring both sides,
      we get the standard equation of a sphere in space with center at
      <m>C=(a,b,c)</m> with radius <m>r</m>,
      as given in the following Key Idea.

      The equation of a sphere is an example of an implicit function defining a surface in space.
      In the case of a sphere,
      the variables <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are all used.
      We now consider situations where surfaces are defined where one or two of these variables are absent.

      The coordinate axes naturally define three planes
      (shown in <xref ref="fig_coordplanes"/>),
      the <em>coordinate planes</em>:
      the <m>xy</m>-plane,
      the <m>yz</m>-plane and the <m>xz</m>-plane.
      The <m>xy</m>-plane is characterized as the set of all points in space where the <m>z</m>-value is 0.
          <idx><h>planes</h><h>coordinate plane</h></idx>
          <idx><h>planes</h><h>introduction</h></idx>
      This, in fact, gives us an equation that describes this plane: <m>z=0</m>.
      Likewise, the <m>xz</m>-plane is all points where the <m>y</m>-value is 0, characterized by <m>y=0</m>.

      The equation <m>x=1</m> obviously lacks the <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> variables,
      meaning it defines points where the <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> coordinates can take on any value.
      Now consider the equation <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>
      <em>in space.</em> In <em>the plane</em>,
      this equation describes a circle of radius 1, centered at the origin.
      In space, the <m>z</m> coordinate is not specified,
      meaning it can take on any value.
      In <xref ref="fig_spacecylinder1a_3D"/>,
      we show part of the graph of the equation
      <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> by sketching 3 circles:
      the bottom one has a constant <m>z</m>-value of <m>-1.5</m>,
      the middle one has a <m>z</m>-value of 0 and the top circle has a <m>z</m>-value of 1.
      By plotting <em>all</em> possible <m>z</m>-values,
      we get the surface shown in <xref ref="fig_spacecylinder1b_3D"/>.
      This surface looks like a <q>tube,</q> or a <q>cylinder</q>;
      mathematicians call this surface a <em>cylinder</em>
      for an entirely different reason.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>C</m> be a curve in a plane and let <m>L</m> be a line not parallel to <m>C</m>.
          A <term>cylinder</term> is the set of all lines parallel to <m>L</m> that pass through <m>C</m>.
          The curve <m>C</m> is the <term>directrix</term> of the cylinder,
          and the lines are the <term>rulings</term>.

      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      In this text,
      we consider curves <m>C</m> that lie in planes parallel to one of the coordinate planes,
      and lines <m>L</m> that are perpendicular to these planes,
      forming <em>right cylinders</em>.
      Thus the directrix can be defined using equations involving 2 variables,
      and the rulings will be parallel to the axis of the third variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example preceding the definition,
      the curve <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane is the directrix and the rulings are lines parallel to the <m>z</m>-axis.
      (Any circle shown in <xref ref="fig_spacecylinder1"/>
      can be considered a directrix;
      we simply choose the one where <m>z=0</m>.)
      Sample rulings can also be viewed in <xref ref="fig_spacecylinder1b_3D"/>.
      More examples will help us understand this definition.

                As <m>x</m> does not appear in the equation,

                shown in <xref ref="fig_space4a2_3D"/>.
                These rulings give a general idea as to what the surface looks like,

      One of the applications of integration we learned previously was to find the volume of solids of revolution <mdash/> solids formed by revolving a curve about a horizontal or vertical axis.
      We now consider how to find the equation of the surface of such a solid.

    <p>
      Consider the surface formed by revolving
      <m>y=\sqrt{x}</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis.
      Cross-sections of this surface parallel to the <m>yz</m>-plane are circles,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_surf_rev_introa_3D"/>.
      Each circle has equation of the form
      <m>y^2+z^2=r^2</m> for some radius <m>r</m>.
      The radius is a function of <m>x</m>;
      in fact, it is <m>r(x) = \sqrt{x}</m>.
      Thus the equation of the surface shown in <xref ref="fig_surf_rev_introb_3D"/> is <m>y^2+z^2=(\sqrt{x})^2</m>.

    <p>
      This particular method of creating surfaces of revolution is limited.
      For instance, in <xref ref="ex_shell4"/>
      of <xref ref="sec_shell_method"/>
      we found the volume of the solid formed by revolving
      <m>y=\sin(x)</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis.
      Our current method of forming surfaces can only rotate
      <m>y=\sin(x)</m> about the <m>x</m>-axis.
      Trying to rewrite <m>y=\sin(x)</m> as a function of <m>y</m> is not trivial,
      as simply writing <m>x=\sin^{-1}(y)</m> only gives part of the region we desire.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we desire is a way of writing the surface of revolution formed by rotating <m>y=f(x)</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis.
      We start by first recognizing this surface is the same as revolving <m>z=f(x)</m> about the <m>z</m>-axis.
      This will give us a more natural way of viewing the surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      A value of <m>x</m> is a measurement of distance from the <m>z</m>-axis.
      At the distance <m>r</m>, we plot a <m>z</m>-height of <m>f(r)</m>.
      When rotating <m>f(x)</m> about the <m>z</m>-axis,
      we want all points a distance of <m>r</m> from the <m>z</m>-axis in the <m>xy</m>-plane to have a <m>z</m>-height of <m>f(r)</m>.
      All such points satisfy the equation <m>r^2=x^2+y^2</m>;
      hence <m>r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m>.
      Replacing <m>r</m> with <m>\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m> in <m>f(r)</m> gives <m>z=f(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})</m>.
      This is the equation of the surface.

    <p>
      We study each shape by considering <em>traces</em>,
          <idx><h>trace</h></idx>
          <idx><h>quadric surface</h><h>trace</h></idx>
      that is, intersections of each surface with a plane parallel to a coordinate plane.
      For instance,
      consider the elliptic paraboloid <m>z= x^2/4+y^2</m>,
      shown in <xref ref="fig_quadric1"/>.
      If we intersect this shape with the plane <m>z=d</m><nbsp/> (<ie/>, replace <m>z</m> with <m>d</m>),
      we have the equation:
      <md>
        <mrow>d \amp = \frac{x^2}4+y^2.</mrow>
        <intertext>Divide both sides by <m>d</m>:</intertext>
        <mrow>1 \amp = \frac{x^2}{4d} + \frac{y^2}{d}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This describes an ellipse <mdash/> so cross sections parallel to the <m>xy</m>-coordinate plane are ellipses.
      This ellipse is drawn in the figure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now consider cross sections parallel to the <m>xz</m>-plane.
      For instance,
      letting <m>y=0</m> gives the equation <m>z=x^2/4</m>, clearly a parabola.
      Intersecting with the plane <m>x=0</m> gives a cross section defined by <m>z=y^2</m>,
      another parabola.
      These parabolas are also sketched in the figure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus we see where the elliptic paraboloid gets its name:
      some cross sections are ellipses, and others are parabolas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such an analysis can be made with each of the quadric surfaces.
      We give a sample equation of each,
      provide a sketch with representative traces,
      and describe these traces.

      One variable in the equation of the elliptic paraboloid will be raised to the first power;

      Multiplying the right hand side by <m>(-1)</m> defines an elliptic paraboloid that <q>opens</q> in the opposite direction.

          <description>
            <p>
              The axes are uncalibrated. Two hollow elliptic cones are drawn with vertices at the origin,
              one opening along the positive <m>z</m> axis and the other along the negative <m>z</m> axis.
              A hyperbola is shown in the <m>y=d</m> plane, the two parts of the hyperbola are traced on the elliptic cone.

        <description>
          <p>
            The three axes are uncalibrated. Graph shows a hyperboloid of one sheet. The hyperboloid of one sheet
            is drawn about the <m>z</m> axis. It appears to be a cylinder with a narrow middle. In the middle of
            the sheet there is a circle drawn on the plane <m>z=o</m>. There are two hyperbolas drawn on the plane
            <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=0</m>.

              The three axes are uncalibrated. There are two parabolas drawn, one in plane
              <m>y=0</m> opening up along the positive <m>z</m> axis in the <m>yz</m> plane
              and the other in <m>x=0</m> opening down along the negative <m>z</m> axis in the
              <m>xz</m> plane. Both parabolas have vertices at the origin.
              Filling the traces gives the hyperbolic paraboloid.

              <p>
                <m>\ds y=\frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{z^2}{16}</m>: We first identify the quadric by pattern-matching with the equations given previously.
                Only two surfaces have equations where one variable is raised to the first power,
                the elliptic paraboloid and the hyperbolic paraboloid.
                In the latter case, the other variables have different signs,
                so we conclude that this describes a hyperbolic paraboloid.
                As the variable with the first power is <m>y</m>,
                we note the paraboloid opens along the <m>y</m>-axis.
                To make a decent sketch by hand,
                we need only draw a few traces.
                In this case,
                the traces <m>x=0</m> and <m>z=0</m> form parabolas that outline the shape.
              </p>
              <p>
                <m>x=0</m>: The trace is the parabola
                <m>y=z^2/16</m>
              </p>
              <p>
                <m>z=0</m>: The trace is the parabola <m>y=x^2/4</m>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Graphing each trace in the respective plane creates a sketch as shown in <xref ref="fig_space5a1_3D"/>.
                This is enough to give an idea of what the paraboloid looks like.
                The surface is filled in in <xref ref="fig_space5a2_3D"/>.

                          The three axes are uncalibrated. Two parabolas are drawn that are perpendicular to
                          each other, one in the <m>xy</m> plane and the other in the <m>yz</m> plane. Both have vertices at origin.
                          Filling in the trace gives the elliptic paraboloid.

                Sketching these two parabolas gives a sketch like that in <xref ref="fig_space5c1_3D"/>, and filling in the surface gives a sketch like <xref ref="fig_space5c2_3D"/>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          The image clearly displays a hyperboloid of two sheets.
          The gallery informs us that the equation will have a form similar to <m>\frac{z^2}{c^2}-\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can immediately eliminate option (a),
          as the constant in that equation is not 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          The hyperboloid <q>opens</q> along the <m>x</m>-axis,
          meaning <m>x</m> must be the only variable with a positive coefficient,
          eliminating (c).
        </p>

        <p>
          The hyperboloid is wider in the <m>z</m>-direction than in the <m>y</m>-direction,
          so we need an equation where <m>c \gt b</m>.
          This eliminates (b), leaving us with (d).
          We should verify that the equation given in (d),
          <m>4x^2-y^2-\frac{z^2}9=1</m>, fits.

        <p>
          We already established that this equation describes a hyperboloid of two sheets that opens in the <m>x</m>-direction and is wider in the <m>z</m>-direction than in the <m>y</m>.
          Now note the coefficient of the <m>x</m>-term.
          Rewriting <m>4x^2</m> in standard form, we have:
          <m>\ds 4x^2 = \frac{x^2}{(1/2)^2}</m>.
          Thus when <m>y=0</m> and <m>z=0</m>,
          <m>x</m> must be <m>1/2</m>;
          <ie/>, each hyperboloid <q>starts</q> at <m>x=1/2</m>.
          This matches our figure.
        </p>

        <p>
          We conclude that <m>\ds 4x^2-y^2-\frac{z^2}9=1</m> best fits the graph.

      This section has introduced points in space and shown how equations can describe surfaces.
      The next sections explore <em>vectors</em>,
      an important mathematical object that we'll use to explore curves in space.

                        Viewed with the <m>y</m> axis pointing out the page,
                        the surface looks like the graph <m>z=x^3</m> in the <m>xz</m> plane.
                        The rest of the surface is generated by sliding this curve back and forth along the <m>y</m> axis.
                        The result is a sheet that looks something like a lounge chair.

                      <p>
                        Viewed along the <m>z</m> axis, the surface appears to be the hyperbola <m>y=1/x</m>.
                        From other angles, it is a pair of curved sheets, bent in the shape of a hyperbola.
