  <title>Extreme Values</title>
  <p>
    Given any quantity described by a function,
    we are often interested in the largest and/or smallest values that quantity attains.
    For instance, if a function describes the speed of an object,
    it seems reasonable to want to know the fastest/slowest the object traveled.
    If a function describes the value of a stock,
    we might want to know the highest/lowest values the stock attained over the past year.
    We call such values <em>extreme values.</em>

    The function displayed in <xref ref="fig_extreme1"/> has a maximum,
    but no minimum,
    as the interval over which the function is defined is open.
    In <xref ref="fig_extreme2"/>, the function has a minimum,

    It is possible for discontinuous functions defined on an open interval to have both a maximum and minimum value,
    but we have just seen examples where they did not.
    On the other hand,
    continuous functions on a closed interval <em>always</em>
    have a maximum and minimum value.

    This theorem states that <m>f</m> has extreme values,
    but it does not offer any advice about how/where to find these values.
    The process can seem to be fairly easy,

    After the example,
    we will draw on lessons learned to form a more general and powerful method for finding extreme values.

        The graph is drawn in such a way to draw attention to certain points.
        It certainly seems that the smallest <m>y</m>-value is <m>-27</m>,
        found when <m>x=3</m>.
        It also seems that the largest <m>y</m>-value is <m>25</m>,
        found at the endpoint of <m>I</m>, <m>x=5</m>.
        We use the word <em>seems</em>,
        for by the graph alone we cannot be sure the smallest value is not less than <m>-27</m>.
        Since the problem asks for an approximation,
        we approximate the extreme values to be <m>25</m> and <m>-27</m>.

  <p>
    Notice how the minimum value came at
    <q>the bottom of a hill,</q>
    and the maximum value came at an endpoint.
    Also note that while <m>0</m> is not an extreme value,
    it would be if we narrowed our interval to <m>[-1,4]</m>.
    The idea that the point <m>(0,0)</m> is the location of an extreme value for some interval is important,
    leading us to a definition of a
    <em>relative maximum</em>.
    In short, a <q>relative max</q>
    is a <m>y</m>-value that's the largest <m>y</m>-value <q>nearby.</q>

    It is easy to check for extrema at endpoints,

        as it is continuous on <m>[-4,2]</m>
        (one should check to verify that <m>\lim\limits_{x\to 0}f(x) =f(0)</m>).
      </p>

      <p>

          <mrow>f(-4)\amp=25\amp f(2)\amp=3</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We now find the critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
        We have to define <m>\fp</m> in a piecewise manner; it is
        <me>
          \fp(x) =\begin{cases}2(x-1) \amp  x \lt  0 \\ 1 \amp  x \gt 0\end{cases}
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that while <m>f</m> is defined for all of <m>[-4,2]</m>,
        <m>\fp</m> is not,
        as the derivative of <m>f</m> does not exist when <m>x=0</m>.
        (From the left, the derivative approaches <m>-2</m>;
        from the right the derivative is <m>1</m>.)
        Thus one critical number of <m>f</m> is <m>x=0</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We now set <m>\fp(x) = 0</m>.
        When <m>x \gt 0</m>, <m>\fp(x)</m> is never 0.
        When <m>x\lt 0</m>,
        <m>\fp(x)</m> is also never 0, so we find no critical values from setting <m>\fp(x)=0</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we have three important <m>x</m>-values to consider:
        <m>x= -4, 2</m> and <m>0</m>.
        Evaluating <m>f</m> at each gives, respectively, <m>25</m>,
        <m>3</m> and <m>1</m>, shown in <xref ref="table_ext5"/>.

        Thus the absolute minimum of <m>f</m> is 1,
        the absolute maximum of <m>f</m> is <m>25</m>.
        Our answer is confirmed by the graph of <m>f</m> in <xref ref="fig_extval5"/>.

        Find the extrema of <m>f(x) = \cos\mathopen{}\left(x^2\right)\mathclose{}</m> on <m>[-2,2]</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We again use <xref ref="idea_extrema"/>.
        Evaluating <m>f</m> at the endpoints of the interval gives:
        <m>f(-2) = f(2) = \cos(4) \approx -0.6536</m>.
        We now find the critical values of <m>f</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Applying the <xref ref="thm_chain_rule" text="title"/>,
        we find <m>\fp(x) = -2x\sin\mathopen{}\left(x^2\right)\mathclose{}</m>.
        Set <m>\fp(x) = 0</m> and solve for <m>x</m> to find the critical values of <m>f</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have <m>\fp(x) = 0</m> when <m>x = 0</m> and when <m>\sin\mathopen{}\left(x^2\right)\mathclose{}</m>.
        In general, <m>\sin(t) = 0</m> when
        <m>t = \ldots -2\pi, -\pi, 0, \pi, \ldots</m> Thus <m>\sin\mathopen{}\left(x^2\right)\mathclose{} = 0</m> when
        <m>x^2 = 0, \pi, 2\pi, \ldots</m> (<m>x^2</m> is always nonnegative so we ignore <m>-\pi</m>,
        etc.) So <m>\sin\mathopen{}\left(x^2\right)\mathclose{}=0</m> when <m>x= 0, \pm \sqrt{\pi}, \pm\sqrt{2\pi}, \ldots</m>.
        The only values to fall in the given interval of <m>[-2,2]</m> are <m>0</m> and <m>\pm\sqrt{\pi}</m>,
        where <m>\sqrt{\pi} \approx 1.77</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We again construct a table of important values in <xref ref="table_ext6"/>.
        In this example we have five values to consider:
        <m>x= 0, \pm 2, \pm\sqrt{\pi}</m>.
        From the table it is clear that the maximum value of <m>f</m> on <m>[-2,2]</m> is <m>1</m>;
        the minimum value is <m>-1</m>.
        The graph in <xref ref="fig_extval6"/> confirms our results.

        The critical points of <m>f</m> are found when

        It is straightforward to find that <m>\fp(x) = 0</m> when <m>x=0</m>,

        and <m>\fp</m> is undefined when <m>x=\pm 1</m>,
        the endpoints of the interval
        (which <em>are</em> in the domain of <m>f</m>.)
        The table of important values is given in <xref ref="table_ext7"/>.

  <p>
    We have seen that continuous functions on closed intervals always have a maximum and minimum value,
    and we have also developed a technique to find these values.
    In <xref ref="sec_mvt"/>,
    we further our study of the information we can glean from <q>nice</q>
    functions with the Mean Value Theorem.
    On a closed interval, we can find the
    <em>average rate of change</em> of a function
    (as we did at the beginning of <xref ref="chapter_derivatives"/>).
    We will see that differentiable functions always have a point at which their <em>instantaneous</em>
    rate of change is same as the <em>average</em> rate of change.
    This is surprisingly useful, as we'll see.

                  <p>
                    The image shows a graph on the intervl <m>[1,5]</m>, with marked points <m>A,B,C,D,E</m>.
                    All five points are part of the graph.
                    The point <m>A</m> is the left endpoint of the graph, and its <m>y</m> value is below any other point on the graph.
                    The graph goes up toward the point <m>B</m>.
                    At <m>B</m> there appears to be a point of non-differentiability,
                    but to the right of <m>B</m> the graph continues to go up toward the point <m>C</m>.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    At <m>C</m> there is another cusp. To the right of <m>C</m>, the graph begins to go down, toward the point <m>D</m>.
                    There is a cusp at <m>D</m> as well, but to the right of <m>D</m>, the graph again goes down, until it reaches the endpoint at <m>E</m>.

                    The graph of <m>f(x)=1+\frac{(x-2)^{2/3}}{x}</m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=0</m>.
                    It descends toward a cusp at <m>(2,1)</m>, which is a relative minimum, and one of the marked points.
                    For <m>x\gt 1</m> the graph rises slowly toward the point <m>\left(6,1+\frac{\sqrt[3]{2}}{3}\right)</m>, which is also marked.
                    The graph is quite flat near this point, and it is hard to tell whether or not it could be a relative maximum.

                    For <m>x\gt 0</m>, <m>f(x)=x</m>, so the slope of the tangent line for positive values of <m>x</m> close to <m>0</m> is <m>1</m>.
