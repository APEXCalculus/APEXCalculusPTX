    When two quantities are related by an equation,
    knowing the value of one quantity can determine the value of the other.
    For instance,
    the circumference and radius of a circle are related by <m>C=2\pi r</m>;
    knowing that <m>C</m> is
    <quantity>
      <mag>6\pi</mag><unit base="inch"/>
    </quantity>
    determines the radius must be
    <quantity>
      <mag>3</mag><unit base="inch"/>
    </quantity>.
  </p>

  <p>
    But what if both variables are changing with time?
    If we know how two variables are related and we know how one of them changes with time,
    can we find how the other variable changes with time?
  </p>

  <p>
    The topic of <term>related rates</term>
    allows us to answer this question:
    knowing the <em>rate</em> at which one quantity is changing can determine the
    <em>rate</em> at which another changes.

    We demonstrate the concepts of related rates through examples.

    <title>Understanding related rates</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The radius of a circle is growing at a rate of
        <quantity>
          <mag>5</mag><unit base="inch"/><per base="hour"/>
        </quantity>.
        At what rate is the circumference growing?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The circumference and radius of a circle are related by <m>C = 2\pi r</m>.
        We are given information about how the length of <m>r</m> changes with respect to time;
        that is, we are told <m>\lz{r}{t}</m> is
        <quantity>
          <mag>5</mag><unit base="inch"/><per base="hour"/>
        </quantity>.
        We want to know how the length of <m>C</m> changes with respect to time,
        <ie/>, we want to know <m>\lz{C}{t}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Implicitly differentiate both sides of
        <m>C = 2\pi r</m> with respect to <m>t</m>:

          <mrow>C \amp = 2\pi r</mrow>
          <mrow>\lzoo{t}{C} \amp = \lzoo{t}{2\pi r}</mrow>
          <mrow>\lz{C}{t} \amp =2\pi \lz{r}{t}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we know <m>\lz{r}{t}</m> is
        <quantity>
          <mag>5</mag><unit base="inch"/><per base="hour"/>
        </quantity>, we know
        <me>
          \lz{C}{t} = 2\pi 5 = 10\pi \approx 31.4\text{ in/hr }

        This problem was relatively straightforward,
        owing to the linear relationship between radius and circumference.

              We can answer this question two ways:
              using <q>common sense</q> or related rates.
              The common sense method states that the volume of the puddle is
              growing by
              <quantity>
                <mag>2</mag><unit base="inch" exp="3"/><per base="second"/>
              </quantity>, where
              <me>
                \text{volume of puddle}=\text{area of circle}\times\text{depth}
              </me>.
              Since the depth is constant at
              <quantity>
                <mag>1/8</mag><unit base="inch"/>
              </quantity>, the area must be growing by
              <quantity>
                <mag>16</mag><unit base="inch" exp="2"/><per base="second"/>
              </quantity>
              since <m>16\cdot \frac{1}{8}=2</m>.
              This approach reveals the underlying related rates principle.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now let's solve the problem using
              <xref ref="idea_relatedrates"/>.
              Based on the problem description,
              the quantities that change with time are the volume of water
              (the volume of the puddle),
              the area of the circular puddle and the radius of the circle.
              We don't need a diagram for this problem.
              The important variables for this part of the problem are the
              volume and area.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let <m>V</m> and <m>A</m> represent the Volume and Area of the puddle.
              We know <m>V= A\times \frac{1}{8}</m>.
              Take the derivative of both sides with respect to <m>t</m>,
              employing implicit differentiation.
              <md>
                <mrow>V \amp = \frac{1}{8}A</mrow>
                <mrow>\lzoo{t}{V}\amp = \lzoo{t}{\frac{1}{8}A}</mrow>
                <mrow>\lz{V}{t} \amp = \frac{1}{8}\lz{A}{t}</mrow>
              </md>
              We know the change in volume, <m>\lz{V}{t} = 2</m>,
              so we substitute this value into our related rates equation:
              <m>2 = \frac{1}{8}\lz{A}{t}</m>,
              and hence <m>\lz{A}{t} = 16</m>.
              Thus the area is growing by
              <quantity>
                <mag>16</mag><unit base="inch" exp="2"/><per base="second"/>
              </quantity>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We already identified the quantities that are changing in
              <xref ref="ex_rr2a" text="local">Part</xref>.
              The variables of interest in this problem are the radius and the volume.
              We need an equation that relates the volume of the circle to the radius.
              Since the puddle is a right circular cylinder,
              we will use a known volume formula,
              <m>V=\pi r^2 h</m> where <m>V</m> is the volume of the puddle (in
              <quantity>
                <unit base="inch" exp="3"/>
              </quantity>, <m>r</m> is the radius
              (in inches)
              and <m>h</m> is the height (<ie/> depth) of the puddle in inches.
              (Notice that this formula is equivalent to
              <m>V=\text{area} \times \text{depth}</m>.)
              We know that the height (depth) is a constant <m>1/8</m> inch.
              Since this quantity does not change in the problem,
              we can safely substitute this value now.
            </p>

            <p>
              Implicitly derive both sides of
              <m>V=\pi r^2 \frac{1}{8}</m> with respect to <m>t</m>:
              <md>
                <mrow>V \amp = \frac{1}{8} \pi r^2</mrow>
                <mrow>\frac{d}{dt}\big(V\big) \amp = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{8}\pi r^2\right)</mrow>
                <mrow>\lz{V}{t} \amp = \frac{1}{8} 2\pi r\lz{r}{t}</mrow>
                <mrow>\lz{V}{t} \amp = \frac{1}{4} \pi r\lz{r}{t}</mrow>
              </md>
              We know that  <m>\lz{V}{t}</m> is
              <quantity>
                <mag>2</mag><unit base="inch" exp="3"/><per base="second"/>
              </quantity>.
              So we have:
              <me>
                2 = \frac14 \pi r\lz{r}{t}
              </me>
              Solving for <m>\lz{r}{t}</m>, we have
              <me>
                \lz{r}{t} = \frac{8}{\pi r}
              </me>.
              Note how our answer is not a number,
              but rather a function of <m>r</m>.
              In other words,
              <em>the rate at which the radius is growing depends on how big
                the circle already is.</em>
              If the circle is very large, adding
              <quantity>
                <mag>2</mag><unit base="inch" exp="3"/><per base="second"/>
              </quantity>
              of water will not make the circle much bigger at all.
              If the circle is dime-sized,
              adding the same amount of water will make a radical change in the
              radius of the circle.
            </p>

            <p>
              In some ways, our problem was (intentionally) ill-posed.
              We need to specify a current (instantaneous) value of the radius
              in order to know a rate of change.
              When the puddle has a radius of
              <quantity>
                <mag>10</mag><unit base="inch"/>
              </quantity>, the radius is growing at a rate of
              <me>
                \lz{r}{t} = \frac{8}{10\pi} = \frac{4}{5\pi} \approx 0.25\text{ in/s }

    <statement>
      <p>
        Radar guns measure the rate of distance change between the gun and the
        object it is measuring.
        For instance, a reading of <q><quantity>
          <mag>55</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
        </quantity></q> means the object is moving away from the gun at a rate
        of <m>55</m> miles per hour,
        whereas a measurement of <q><quantity>
          <mag>-25</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
        </quantity></q> would mean that the object is approaching the gun at a
        rate of <m>25</m> miles per hour.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the radar gun is moving (say,
        attached to a police car) then radar readouts are only immediately
        understandable if the gun and the object are moving along the same line.
        If a police officer is traveling
        <quantity>
          <mag>60</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
        </quantity>
        and gets a readout of
        <quantity>
          <mag>15</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
        </quantity>, he knows that the car ahead of him is moving away at a rate
        of <m>15</m> miles an hour,
        meaning the car is traveling
        <quantity>
          <mag>75</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
        </quantity>. (This straight-line principle is one reason officers park
        on the side of the highway and try to shoot straight back down the road.
        It gives the most accurate reading.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose an officer is driving due north at
        <quantity>
          <mag>30</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
        </quantity>
        and sees a car moving due east,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_rr3"/>.
        Using his radar gun, he measures a reading of
        <quantity>
          <mag>20</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
        </quantity>.
        By using landmarks,

      </p>

    <solution>
      <p>
        The important quantities that are changing are:
        the distance of the officer to the intersection,
        the distance of the car to the intersection,
        and the distance of the officer to the car.
        (There are other quantities that are changing as well such as the
        angles and area of the triangle,
        but these are not important to this problem.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Using the diagram in <xref ref="fig_rr3"/>,
        let's label what we know about the situation.
        As both the police officer and other driver are <m>1/2</m> mile from
        the intersection,
        we have <m>A = 1/2</m>, <m>B = 1/2</m>,
        and through the Pythagorean Theorem,
        <m>C = 1/\sqrt{2}\approx 0.707</m>.
        These values are <q>instantaneous</q>
        values for our variables,
        so we won't use them until the <em>end</em> of the problem.
        Instead, we will use the variables <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>,
        and <m>C</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We need an equation that relates <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>.
        The Pythagorean Theorem is a good choice:
        <m>A^2+B^2 = C^2</m>.
        Differentiate both sides with respect to <m>t</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>A^2 + B^2 \amp = C^2</mrow>
          <mrow>\lzoo{t}{A^2+B^2} \amp = \lzoo{t}{C^2}</mrow>
          <mrow>2A\lz{A}{t} + 2B\lz{B}{t} \amp = 2C\lz{C}{t}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        We know the police officer is traveling at
        <quantity>
          <mag>30</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
        </quantity>; that is, <m>\lz{A}{t} = -30</m>.
        The reason this rate of change is negative is that <m>A</m> is getting
        smaller;
        the distance between the officer and the intersection is shrinking.
        The radar measurement is <m>\lz{C}{t} = 20</m>.
        We want to find <m>\lz{B}{t}</m>.

            It highlights the difficulty in using radar in a nonlinear fashion,

          <p>
            The principles here are important, though.
            Many automated vehicles make judgments about other moving objects based on

        </me>.

        We need to convert the measurements so they use the same units

      <p>
        We want to know the fastest the camera has to turn.
        Common sense tells us this is when the car is directly in front of the
        camera (<ie/>, when <m>\theta = 0</m>).
        Our mathematics bears this out.
        In <xref ref="eq_rr4b" text="global">Equation</xref>
        we see this is when <m>\cos^2(\theta)</m> is largest;
        this is when <m>\cos(\theta) = 1</m>,
        or when <m>\theta = 0</m>.
        We also know that we should get an answer that is in
        <quantity>
          <unit base="radian"/><per base="second"/>
        </quantity>.
        Since <m>\cos(\theta)</m> is a <q>dimensionless</q> measure,
        it won't contribute to the units.
        However, radians are also dimensionless.
        This means we can write
        (or erase)
        the word <q>radian</q> without any unit consequences. (The same is not
        true of degrees <mdash/> always convert degress to radians).
      </p>

      <p>
        With <m>\lz{x}{t}</m> approximately
        <quantity>
          <mag>-146.7</mag><unit base="foot"/><per base="second"/>
        </quantity>, we have
        <md>
          <mrow>\lz{\theta}{t} \amp \approx -\frac{1}{10\text{ ft } }146.67\text{ ft/s }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = -14.667\text{ radians/s }</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        We find that <m>\lz{\theta}{t}</m> is negative;
        this matches our diagram in <xref ref="fig_rr4"/>
        for <m>\theta</m> is getting smaller as the car approaches the camera.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is the practical meaning of
        <quantity>
          <mag>-14.667</mag><unit base="radian"/><per base="second"/>
        </quantity>?
        Recall that <m>1</m> circular revolution goes through <m>2\pi</m>
        radians, thus
        <quantity>
          <mag>14.667</mag><unit base="radian"/><per base="second"/>
        </quantity>
        means <m>14.667/(2\pi)\approx 2.33</m> revolutions per second.
        The negative sign indicates the camera is rotating in a clockwise fashion.

        and perhaps you found them less interesting as a result.

        Give an example of a problem from another subject you are studying that can be stated as a related rates problem.
        What are the quantities involved? What are the units of these quantities? How are they related?
        What are the relevant rates of change and their units?

    We introduced the derivative as a function that gives the slopes of tangent
    lines of functions.
    This chapter emphasizes using the derivative in other ways.
    Newton's Method uses the derivative to approximate roots of functions;
    this section stresses the <q>rate of change</q>
    aspect of the derivative to find a relationship between the rates of change
    of two related quantities.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the next section we use Extreme Value concepts to
    <em>optimize</em> quantities.

              A rope, attached to a weight,
              goes up through a pulley at the ceiling and back down to a worker.

                  The diagram illustrates a weight connected to a <quantity><mag>60</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> long rope, with the other end looped through a pulley affixed to the ceiling, <quantity><mag>30</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> above the weight's resting position. Adjacent to the weight, a worker is depicted holding the rope, specifically at its attachment point to the weight. As the worker moves away at 2 ft/s, pulling the rope with him, the weight begins its ascent.
