  <title>Interpretations of the Derivative</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      <xref ref="sec_derivative"/>
      defined the derivative of a function and gave examples of how to compute it using its definition (<ie/>, using limits).
      The section also started with a brief motivation for this definition, that is,
      finding the instantaneous velocity of a falling object given its position function.
      <xref ref="sec_basic_diff_rules"/>
      will give us more accessible tools for computing the derivative;
      tools that are easier to use than repeated use of limits.
    </p>

    <p>
      This section falls in between the
      <q>What is the definition of the derivative?</q>
      and <q>How do I compute the derivative?</q> sections.
      Here we are concerned with <q>What does the derivative mean?</q>,
      or perhaps,
      when read with the right emphasis,
      <q>What <em>is</em> the derivative?</q>
      We offer two interconnected interpretations of the derivative,
      hopefully explaining why we care about it and why it is worthy of study.

  <subsection>
    <title>Interpretation of the Derivative as Instantaneous Rate of Change</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="sec_derivative"/>
      started with an example of using the position of an object
      (in this case, a falling amusement park rider)
      to find the object's velocity.
      This type of example is often used when introducing the derivative because we tend to readily recognize that velocity is the
      <em>instantaneous rate of change in position.</em> In general,
      if <m>f</m> is a function of <m>x</m>,
      then <m>\fp(x)</m> measures the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.
      Put another way, the derivative answers
      <q>When <m>x</m> changes,
      at what rate does <m>f</m> change?</q>
      Thinking back to the amusement park ride,
      we asked <q>When time changed,
      at what rate did the height change?</q>
      and found the answer to be <q>By <m>-64</m> feet per second.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now imagine driving a car and looking at the speedometer,
      which reads <q><quantity>
        <mag>60</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
      </quantity>.</q> Five minutes later,
      you wonder how far you have traveled.
      Certainly, lots of things could have happened in those <m>5</m> minutes;
      you could have intentionally sped up significantly,
      you might have come to a complete stop, you might have slowed to
      <quantity>
        <mag>20</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
      </quantity>
      as you passed through construction.
      But suppose that you know, as the driver,
      none of these things happened.
      You know you maintained a fairly consistent speed over those <m>5</m> minutes.
      What is a good approximation of the distance traveled?
    </p>

    <p>
      One could argue the <em>only</em> good approximation,
      given the information provided,
      would be based on <q><m>\text{distance} = \text{rate}\times\text{time.}</m></q> In this case,
      we assume a constant rate of
      <quantity>
        <mag>60</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
      </quantity>
      with a time of <m>5</m> minutes or <m>5/60</m> of an hour.
      Hence we would approximate the distance traveled as <m>5</m> miles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Referring back to the falling amusement park ride,
      knowing that at <m>t=2</m> the velocity was <m>-64</m> ft/s, we could reasonably approximate that <m>1</m> second later the riders' height would have dropped by about <m>64</m> feet.
      Knowing that the riders were <em>accelerating</em>
      as they fell would inform us that this is an
      <em>under-approximation</em>.
      If all we knew was that <m>f(2) = 86</m> and <m>\fp(2) = -64</m>,
      we'd know that we'd have to stop the riders quickly otherwise they would hit the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      In both of these cases,
      we are using the instantaneous rate of change to predict future values of the output.

    <title>Units of the Derivative</title>
    <p>
      It is useful to recognize the <em>units</em>
      of the derivative function.
      If <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>,
      <ie/>, <m>y=f(x)</m> for some function <m>f</m>,
      and <m>y</m> is measured in feet and <m>x</m> in seconds,
      then the units of <m>y' = \fp</m> are
      <q>feet per second,</q>
      commonly written as <q>ft/s.</q> In general,
      if <m>y</m> is measured in units <m>P</m> and <m>x</m> is measured in units <m>Q</m>,
      then <m>y'</m> will be measured in units
      <q><m>P</m> per <m>Q</m></q>,
      or <q><m>P/Q</m>.</q> Here we see the fraction-like behavior of the derivative in the notation:
      the units of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>are <m>\frac{\text{units of }y}{\text{units of }x}</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_der_meaning1">
      <title>The meaning of the derivative: World Population</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>P(t)</m> represent the world population <m>t</m> minutes after 12:00 a.m., January 1, 2012.
          It is fairly accurate to say that <m>P(0) = 7{,}028{,}734{,}178</m>
          (<url href="https://www.prb.org" visual="www.prb.org"/>).
          It is also fairly accurate to state that <m>P'(0) = 156</m>;
          that is, at midnight on January 1, 2012,
          the population of the world was growing by about 156
          <em>people per minute</em>
          (note the units).
          Twenty days later
          (or <m>28{,}800</m> minutes later)
          we could reasonably assume the population grew by about <m>28{,}800\cdot156 = 4{,}492{,}800</m> people.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex_der_meaning2">
      <title>The meaning of the derivative: Manufacturing</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The term <em>widget</em> is an economic term for a generic unit of manufacturing output.
          Suppose a company produces widgets and knows that the market supports a price of <m>\$10</m> per widget.
          Let <m>P(n)</m> give the profit, in dollars,
          earned by manufacturing and selling <m>n</m> widgets.
          The company likely cannot make a (positive) profit making just one widget;
          the start-up costs will likely exceed <m>\$10</m>.
          Mathematically, we would write this as <m>P(1) \lt 0</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          What do <m>P(1000) = 500</m> and <m>P'(1000)=0.25</m> mean?
          Approximate <m>P(1100)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The equation <m>P(1000)=500</m> means that selling <m>1000</m> widgets returns a profit of <m>\$500</m>.
          We interpret <m>P'(1000) = 0.25</m> as meaning that when we are selling <m>1000</m> widgets,
          the profit is increasing at rate of <m>\$0.25</m> per widget
          (the units are <q>dollars per widget.</q>)
          Since we have no other information to use,
          our best approximation for <m>P(1100)</m> is:
          <md>
            <mrow>P(1100) \amp \approx P(1000) + P'(1000)\times100</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= \$500 + (100\text{ widgets })\cdot \$0.25/\text{widget}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= \$525</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We approximate that selling <m>1100</m> widgets returns a profit of <m>\$525</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      The previous examples made use of an important approximation tool that we first used in our previous <q>driving a car at
      <quantity>
        <mag>60</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
      </quantity></q> example at the beginning of this section.
      Five minutes after looking at the speedometer,
      our best approximation for distance traveled assumed the rate of change was constant.
      In <xref ref="ex_der_meaning1">Examples</xref>
      and <xref ref="ex_der_meaning2"/>
      we made similar approximations.
      We were given rate of change information which we used to approximate total change.
      Notationally, we would say that
      <me>
        f(c+h) \approx f(c) + \fp(c)\cdot h
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approximation is best when <m>h</m> is <q>small.</q>
      <q>Small</q> is a relative term;
      when dealing with the world population,
      <m>h=22\text{ days} = 28{,}800\text{ minutes}</m> is small in comparison to years.
      When manufacturing widgets,
      <m>100</m> widgets is small when one plans to manufacture thousands.

    <title>The Derivative and Motion</title>
    <p>
      One of the most fundamental applications of the derivative is the study of motion.
      Let <m>s(t)</m> be a position function,
      where <m>t</m> is time and <m>s(t)</m> is distance.
      For instance,
      <m>s</m> could measure the height of a projectile or the distance an object has traveled.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <title>Convention with <m>s</m></title>
      <p>
        Using <m>s(t)</m> to represent position is a fairly common mathematical convention.
        It is also common to use <m>s</m> to represent arc length.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Let <m>s(t)</m> measure the distance traveled,
      in feet, of an object after <m>t</m> seconds of travel.
      Then <m>s'(t)</m> has units <q>feet per second,</q>
      and <m>s'(t)</m> measures the <em>instantaneous rate of distance change with respect to time</em>
      <mdash/> it measures <em>velocity</em>.
          <idx><h>velocity</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now consider <m>v(t)</m>, a velocity function.
      That is, at time <m>t</m>, <m>v(t)</m> gives the velocity of an object.
      The derivative of <m>v</m>, <m>v'(t)</m>,
      gives the <em>instantaneous rate of velocity change with respect to time</em>
      <mdash/> <em>acceleration</em>.
      (We often think of acceleration in terms of cars:
      a car may <q>go from <m>0</m> to <m>60</m> in <m>4.8</m> seconds.</q>
      This is an <em>average</em> acceleration,
      a measurement of how quickly the velocity changed.)
      If velocity is measured in feet per second,
      and time is measured in seconds,
      then the units of acceleration (<ie/>, the units of <m>v'(t)</m>) are
      <q>feet per second per second,</q>
      or <m>(</m>ft/s<m>)</m>/s.
      We often shorten this to <q>feet per second squared,</q> or
      <quantity>
        <unit base="foot"/><per base="second" exp="2"/>
      </quantity>, but this tends to obscure the meaning of the units.

          <idx><h>acceleration</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps the most well known acceleration is that of gravity.
      In this text,
      we use <m>g=32\,\text{ft}/\text{s}^2</m> or <m>g=9.8\,\text{m}/\text{s}^2</m>.
      What do these numbers mean?
    </p>

    <p>
      A constant acceleration of
      <m>32\,\frac{\text{ft}/\text{s}}{\text{s}}</m> means that the velocity changes by <m>32\,\text{ft}/\text{s}</m> each second.
      For instance,
      let <m>v(t)</m> measure the velocity of a ball thrown straight up into the air,
      where <m>v</m> has units ft/s and <m>t</m> is measured in seconds.
      The ball will have a positive velocity while traveling upwards and a negative velocity while falling down.
      The acceleration is thus <m>-32\,\text{ft}/\text{s}^2</m>.
      If <m>v(1) = 20\,\text{ft}/\text{s}</m>,
      then <m>1</m> second later,
      the velocity will have decreased by <m>32\,\text{ft}/\text{s}</m>;
      that is, <m>v(2) = -12\,\text{ft/s}</m>.
      We can continue: <m>v(3) = -44\,\text{ft/s}</m>.
      Working backward,
      we can also figure that <m>v(0) = 52\,\text{ft}/\text{s}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      These ideas are so important we write them out as a Key Idea.

    <title>Interpretation of the Derivative as the Slope of the Tangent Line</title>
    <p>
      We now consider the second interpretation of the derivative given in this section.
      This interpretation is not independent from the first by any means;
      many of the same concepts will be stressed,
      just from a slightly different perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a function <m>y=f(x)</m>,
      the difference quotient <m>\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}</m> gives a change in <m>y</m> values divided by a change in <m>x</m> values;
      <ie/>, it is a measure of the <q>rise over run,</q> or <q>slope,</q>
      of the secant line that goes through two points on the graph of <m>f</m>:
      <m>(c, f(c))</m> and <m>(c+h,f(c+h))</m>.
      As <m>h</m> shrinks to <m>0</m>,
      these two points come close together;
      in the limit we find <m>\fp(c)</m>,
      the slope of a special line called the tangent line that intersects <m>f</m> only once near <m>x=c</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lines have a constant rate of change, their slope.
      Nonlinear functions do not have a constant rate of change,
      but we can measure their <em>instantaneous rate of change</em>
      at a given <m>x</m> value <m>c</m> by computing <m>\fp(c)</m>.
      We can get an idea of how <m>f</m> is behaving by looking at the slopes of its tangent lines.
      We explore this idea in the following example.
    </p>

        <p>
          With practice,
          one can fairly effectively sketch tangent lines to a curve at a particular point.
          In <xref ref="fig_xsquaredwithgrid"/>,
          we have sketched the tangent lines to <m>f</m> at <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=3</m>,
          along with a grid to help us measure the slopes of these lines.
          At <m>x=1</m>, the slope is <m>2</m>;
          at <m>x=3</m>, the slope is <m>6</m>.
          Thus we can say not only is <m>f</m> growing faster at <m>x=3</m> than at <m>x=1</m>,
          it is growing <em>three times as fast</em>.

                The graph of <m>f</m> starts close to <m>(0, 3)</m>. It curves upwards tracing the path of a projectile. Up to <m>(3.1, 4.2)</m> in the first quadrant it moves straight

        <p>
          While the tangent line to <m>f</m> was drawn in <xref ref="ex_der_meaning4"/>,
          it was not explicitly computed.
          Recall that the tangent line to <m>f</m> at <m>x=c</m> is <m>y = \fp(c)(x-c)+f(c)</m>.
          While <m>f</m> is not explicitly given,
          by the graph it looks like <m>f(3) = 4</m>.
          Recalling that <m>\fp(3) = 3</m>,
          we can compute the tangent line to be approximately <m>y = 3(x-3)+4</m>.
          It is often useful to leave the tangent line in point-slope form.
        </p>

        <p>
          To use the tangent line to approximate <m>f(3.1)</m>,
          we simply evaluate <m>y</m> at <m>3.1</m> instead of <m>f</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>f(3.1) \amp \approx y(3.1)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= 3(3.1-3)+4</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp= 0.1\cdot3+4</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 4.3</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We approximate <m>f(3.1) \approx 4.3</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      To demonstrate the accuracy of the tangent line approximation,
      we now state that in <xref ref="ex_der_meaning5"/>,
      <m>f(x) = -x^3+7x^2-12x+4</m>.
      We can evaluate <m>f(3.1) = 4.279</m>.
      Had we known <m>f</m> all along,
      certainly we could have just made this computation.
      In reality, we often only know two things:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            what <m>f(c)</m> is, for some value of <m>c</m>, and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            what <m>\fp(c)</m> is.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance,
      we can easily observe the location of an object and its instantaneous velocity at a particular point in time.
      We do not have a <q>function <m>f</m></q>
      for the location, just an observation.
      This is enough to create an approximating function for <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This last example has a direct connection to our approximation method explained above after <xref ref="ex_der_meaning2"/>.
      We stated there that
      <me>
        f(c+h) \approx f(c)+\fp(c)\cdot h
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we know <m>f(c)</m> and <m>\fp(c)</m> for some value <m>x=c</m>,
      then computing the tangent line at <m>(c,f(c))</m> is easy:
      <m>y(x) = \fp(c)(x-c)+f(c)</m>.
      In <xref ref="ex_der_meaning5"/>,
      we used the tangent line to approximate a value of <m>f</m>.
      Let's use the tangent line at <m>x=c</m> to approximate a value of <m>f</m> near <m>x=c</m>;
      <ie/>, compute <m>y(c+h)</m> to approximate <m>f(c+h)</m>,
      assuming again that <m>h</m> is <q>small.</q> Note:
      <md>
        <mrow>y(c+h) \amp = \fp(c)\left((c+h)-c\right)+f(c)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \fp(c)\cdot h + f(c)</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the exact same approximation method used above!
      Not only does it make intuitive sense,
      as explained above, it makes analytical sense,
      as this approximation method is simply using a tangent line to approximate a function's value.
    </p>

    <p>
      The importance of understanding the derivative cannot be understated.
      When <m>f</m> is a function of <m>x</m>,
      <m>\fp(x)</m> measures the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m> and gives the slope of the tangent line to <m>f</m> at <m>x</m>.

                    The graph of f is a line with slope <m>2a</m> and the <m>x</m> intercept <m>h</m>.
                    The value of the random variable <m>a</m> decides what the graphs look like.
                    Note that the graph of <m>f</m> is always a line and the graph of <m>g</m> is always a hyperbola.

                    a downwards parabola with its vertex at <m>(-2, 1)</m>. One of its arms intersect
                    the negative <m>x</m> axis at <m>x=-1</m> and the other at <m>x=-1</m>.
                    The graph of <m>f</m> intersects the graph of <m>g</m> twice, once in the second quadrant

                    The graph of <m>f</m> is a hyperbola with curves in the first and the third quadrant. The curves look like infinite bows with the branches extending in
                    positive and negative <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions. The curve in the first quadrant has its vertex at <m>(1, 1)</m>. The two branches of the curve extend
                    towards positive <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axis. They continue moving in their respective directions while they get closer to the <m>x</m> and the <m>y</m> axis
                    without ever merging with them. The curve in the third qudrant has its vertex at <m>(-1, -1)</m> and the two branches of this one move towards the negative <m>x</m>
                    and <m>y</m> axis in the exact manner as the curve in the first quadrant creating a mirror image of the first curve. The graph of <m>g</m> also consists of two
                    curves, one in the third and one in the fourth quadrant that are mirror images of each other. The curve in the fourth quadrant is shaped like an inverted L. The
                    focus of the curve is located close to <m>(1, -0.5)</m>. From there, one of branches move upwards to the right until it merges with the positive <m>x</m> axis and
                    continues along with it. The other branch moves downwards while moving slightly to its left and then contines vertically downwards parallel to the negative <m>y</m>
                    axis. The curve in the third qudrant is a mirror image of the previous curve. It follows the part of <m>f</m> in the third quadrant closely intersecting <m>f</m>
                    at <m>(-1, -1)</m>.
