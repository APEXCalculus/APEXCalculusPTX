  <title>Triple Integration with Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Just as polar coordinates gave us a new way of describing curves in the plane,
      in this section we will see how
      <em>cylindrical</em> and <em>spherical</em>
      coordinates give us new ways of desribing surfaces and regions in space.

  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Cylindrical Coordinates</title>
    <p>
      In short, cylindrical coordinates can be thought of as a combination of the polar and rectangular coordinate systems.
      One can identify a point <m>(x_0,y_0,z_0)</m>,
      given in rectangular coordinates,
      with the point <m>(r_0,\theta_0,z_0)</m>,
      given in cylindrical coordinates,
      where the <m>z</m>-value in both systems is the same,
      and the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane is identified with the polar point <m>P(r_0,\theta_0)</m>;
      see <xref ref="fig_cylindricalintro">Figure</xref>.
      So that each point in space that does not lie on the <m>z</m>-axis is defined uniquely,
      we will restrict <m>r\geq 0</m> and <m>0\leq \theta\leq 2\pi</m>.

      We use the identity <m>z=z</m> along with the identities found in <xref ref="idea_polarconvert">Key Idea</xref>
      to convert between the rectangular coordinate <m>(x,y,z)</m> and the cylindrical coordinate <m>(r,\theta,z)</m>, namely:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{l} \text{ From rectangular to cylindrical: }  r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}, \tan\theta = y/x \text{ and }  z=z;\\ \text{ From cylindrical to rectangular: }   x=r\cos\theta y=r\sin\theta \text{ and }  z=z. \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      These identities,
      along with conversions related to spherical coordinates,
      are given later in <xref ref="idea_convert_coords">Key Idea</xref>.

    <aside>
      <p>
        <em>Note:</em> Our rectangular to polar conversion formulas used <m>r^2=x^2+y^2</m>,
        allowing for negative <m>r</m> values.

    <p>
      Cylindrical coordinates are useful when describing certain domains in space,
      allowing us to evaluate triple integrals over these domains more easily than if we used rectangular coordinates.
    </p>

    <p>
      <xref ref="thm_triple_integration2">Theorem</xref>
      shows how to evaluate <m>\iiint_Dh(x,y,z)\ dV</m> using rectangular coordinates.
      In that evaluation, we use <m>dV = dz\,dy\,dx</m>
      (or one of the other five orders of integration).
      Recall how, in this order of integration,
      the bounds on <m>y</m> are <q>curve to curve</q>
      and the bounds on <m>x</m> are <q>point to point</q>:
      these bounds describe a region <m>R</m> in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane.
      We could describe <m>R</m> using polar coordinates as done in <xref ref="sec_double_int_polar">Section</xref>.
      In that section, we saw how we used
      <m>dA = r\,dr\,d\theta</m> instead of <m>dA = dy\,dx</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Considering the above thoughts,
      we have <m>dV = dz\big(r\,dr\,d\theta\big) = r\,dz\,dr\,d\theta</m>.
      We set bounds on <m>z</m> as <q>surface to surface</q>
      as done in the previous section,
      and then use <q>curve to curve</q>
      and <q>point to point</q>
      bounds on <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m>, respectively.
      Finally, using the identities given above,
      we change the integrand <m>h(x,y,z)</m> to <m>h(r,\theta,z)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This process should sound plausible;
      the following theorem states it is truly a way of evaluating a triple integral.

    <p>
      In short, spherical coordinates can be thought of as a
      <q>double application</q>
      of the polar coordinate system.
      In spherical coordinates,
      a point <m>P</m> is identified with <m>(\rho,\theta,\varphi)</m>,
      where <m>\rho</m> is the distance from the origin to <m>P</m>,
      <m>\theta</m> is the same angle as would be used to describe <m>P</m> in the cylindrical coordinate system,
      and <m>\varphi</m> is the angle between the positive <m>z</m>-axis and the ray from the origin to <m>P</m>;
      see <xref ref="fig_sphericalintro">Figure</xref>.
      So that each point in space that does not lie on the <m>z</m>-axis is defined uniquely,
      we will restrict <m>\rho \geq 0</m>,
      <m>0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi</m> and <m>0 \leq \varphi \leq \pi</m>.

        <em>Note:</em> The symbol <m>\rho</m> is the Greek letter <q>rho.</q>
        Traditionally it is used in the spherical coordinate system,
        while <m>r</m> is used in the polar and cylindrical coordinate systems.

          we find <m>\rho = \sqrt{2^2+(-1)^2+1^2} = 3</m>.

      Spherical coordinates are useful when describing certain domains in space,
      allowing us to evaluate triple integrals over these domains more easily than if we used rectangular coordinates or cylindrical coordinates.
      The crux of setting up a triple integral in spherical coordinates is appropriately describing the
      <q>small amount of volume,</q>
      <m>dV</m>, used in the integral.
    </p>

    <p>
      Considering <xref ref="fig_sphericalwedge">Figure</xref>,
      we can make a small <q>spherical wedge</q> by varying <m>\rho</m>,
      <m>\theta</m> and <m>\varphi</m> each a small amount, <m>\Delta\rho</m>,
      <m>\Delta\theta</m> and <m>\Delta\varphi</m>, respectively.
      This wedge is approximately a rectangular solid when the change in each coordinate is small,
      giving a volume of about
      <me>
        \Delta V \approx \Delta\rho\ \times\ \rho\Delta\varphi\ \times\ \rho\sin(\varphi)\Delta\theta
      </me>.

    <p>
      Given a region <m>D</m> in space,
      we can approximate the volume of <m>D</m> with many such wedges.
      As the size of each of <m>\Delta\rho</m>,
      <m>\Delta\theta</m> and <m>\Delta\varphi</m> goes to zero,
      the number of wedges increases to infinity and the volume of <m>D</m> is more accurately approximated, giving
      <me>
        dV = d\rho\ \times\ \rho\ d\varphi\ \times\ \rho\sin(\varphi)d\theta = \rho^2\sin(\varphi)\ d\rho\ d\theta\ d\varphi
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, this development of <m>dV</m> should sound reasonable,

        it often does not matter whether we next integrate with respect to <m>\theta</m> or <m>\varphi</m>.
        Different texts present different standard orders,
        some preferring <m>d\varphi\ d\theta</m> instead of <m>d\theta\ d\varphi</m>.
        As the bounds for these variables are usually constants in practice,
        it generally is a matter of preference.

      This section has provided a brief introduction into two new coordinate systems useful for identifying points in space.
      Each can be used to define a variety of surfaces in space beyond the canonical surfaces graphed as each system was introduced.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the usefulness of these coordinate systems does not lie in the variety of surfaces that they can describe nor the regions in space these surfaces may enclose.
      Rather, cylindrical coordinates are mostly used to describe cylinders and spherical coordinates are mostly used to describe spheres.
      These shapes are of special interest in the sciences, especially in physics,
      and computations on/inside these shapes is difficult using rectangular coordinates.
      For instance, in the study of electricity and magnetism,
      one often studies the effects of an electrical current passing through a wire;
      that wire is essentially a cylinder,
      described well by cylindrical coordinates.
    </p>

    <p>
      This chapter investigated the natural follow<ndash />on to partial derivatives:
      iterated integration.
      We learned how to use the bounds of a double integral to describe a region in the plane using both rectangular and polar coordinates,
      then later expanded to use the bounds of a triple integral to describe a region in space.
      We used double integrals to find volumes under surfaces,
      surface area,
      and the center of mass of lamina;
      we used triple integrals as an alternate method of finding volumes of space regions and also to find the center of mass of a region in space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Integration does not stop here.
      We could continue to iterate our integrals,
      next investigating <q>quadruple integrals</q>
      whose bounds describe a region in 4<ndash />dimensional space
      (which are very hard to visualize).
      We can also look back to <q>regular</q>
      integration where we found the area under a curve in the plane.
      A natural analogue to this is finding the
      <q>area under a curve,</q>
      where the curve is in space, not in a plane.
      These are just two of many avenues to explore under the heading of <q>integration.</q>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Explain the difference between the roles <m>r</m>,
          in cylindrical coordinates, and <m>\rho</m>,
          in spherical coordinates, play in determining the location of a point.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          In cylindrical,
          <m>r</m> determines how far from the origin one goes in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane before considering the <m>z</m>-component.
          Equivalently,
          if on projects a point in cylindrical coordinates onto the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane,
          <m>r</m> will be the distance of this projection from the origin.
        </p>

        <p>
          In spherical,
          <m>\rho</m> is the distance from the origin to the point.
        </p>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Why are points on the <m>z</m>-axis not determined uniquely when using cylindrical and spherical coordinates?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          If <m>r=0</m> or <m>\rho=0</m>,
          then the point in each coordinate system lies on the <m>z</m>-axis regardless of the value of <m>\theta</m>.

        <p>
          Spherical appears simplest,
          avoiding the integration of square-roots and using techniques such as Substitution;
          all bounds are constants.
