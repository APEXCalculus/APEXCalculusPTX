    <p>
      A common use of vector<ndash />valued functions is to describe the motion of an object in the plane or in space.
      A <em>position function</em>
      <m>\vec r(t)</m> gives the position of an object at <em>time</em> <m>t</m>.
      This section explores how derivatives and integrals are used to study the motion described by such a function.

          An object is moving with position function

                These are plotted with \vec r(t)<nbsp />in <xref ref="fig_motion1">Figure</xref>(a).
                We can think of acceleration as <q>pulling</q>
                the velocity vector in a certain direction.
                At <m>t=-1</m>, the velocity vector points down and to the left;
                at <m>t=1</m>, the velocity vector has been pulled in the
                <m>\la 2,2\ra</m> direction and is now pointing up and to the right.
                In <xref ref="fig_motion1">Figure</xref>(b) we plot more velocity/acceleration vectors,
                making more clear the effect acceleration has on velocity.

                Since <m>\vat</m> is constant in this example,
                as <m>t</m> grows large \vec v(t)<nbsp />becomes almost parallel to \vec a(t).
                For instance, when <m>t=10</m>,
                <m>\vec v(10) = \la 19,21\ra</m>,
                which is nearly parallel to <m>\la 2,2\ra</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                The object's speed is given by
                <me>
                  \norm{\vvt} = \sqrt{(2t-1)^2+(2t+1)^2} =\sqrt{8t^2+2}
                </me>.
                To find the minimal speed, we could apply calculus techniques
                (such as set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for <m>t</m>, etc.)
                but we can find it by inspection.
                Inside the square root we have a quadratic which is minimized when <m>t=0</m>.
                Thus the speed is minimized at <m>t=0</m>,
                with a speed of <m>\sqrt{2}</m> ft/s.
                The graph in <xref ref="fig_motion1">Figure</xref>(b) also implies speed is minimized here.
                The filled dots on the graph are located at integer values of <m>t</m> between <m>-3</m> and 3.
                Dots that are far apart imply the object traveled a far distance in 1 second,
                indicating high speed;
                dots that are close together imply the object did not travel far in 1 second,
                indicating a low speed.
                The dots are closest together near <m>t=0</m>,
                implying the speed is minimized near that value.

      <title>Analyzing Motion</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Two objects follow an identical path at different rates on <m>[-1,1]</m>.
          The position function for Object 1 is <m>\vec r_1(t) = \la t, t^2\ra</m>;
          the position function for Object 2 is <m>\vec r_2(t) = \la t^3, t^6\ra</m>,
          where distances are measured in feet and time is measured in seconds.
          Compare the velocity,
          speed and acceleration of the two objects on the path.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We begin by computing the velocity and acceleration function for each object:
          <md>
            <mrow>\vec v_1(t) \amp = \la 1,2t\ra \amp  \vec v_2(t) \amp = \la 3t^2,6t^5\ra</mrow>
            <mrow>\vec a_1(t) \amp = \la 0,2\ra \amp  \vec a_2(t) \amp =\la 6t,30t^4\ra</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          We immediately see that Object 1 has constant acceleration,
          whereas Object 2 does not.
        </p>

        <p>
          At <m>t=-1</m>,
          we have <m>\vec v_1(-1) = \la 1,-2\ra</m> and <m>\vec v_2(-1) = \la 3,-6\ra</m>;
          the velocity of Object 2 is three times that of Object 1 and so it follows that the speed of Object 2 is three times that of Object 1 (<m>3\sqrt{5}</m> ft/s compared to <m>\sqrt{5}</m> ft/s.)

        <p>
          At <m>t=0</m>, the velocity of Object 1 is
          <m>\vec v(1) = \la 1,0\ra</m> and the velocity of Object 2 is <m>\vec 0</m>!
          This tells us that Object 2 comes to a complete stop at <m>t=0</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In <xref ref="fig_motion2a">Figure</xref>,
          we see the velocity and acceleration vectors for Object 1 plotted for <m>t=-1, -1/2, 0, 1/2</m> and <m>t=1</m>.
          Note again how the constant acceleration vector seems to <q>pull</q>
          the velocity vector from pointing down, right to up, right.
          We could plot the analogous picture for Object 2, but the velocity and acceleration vectors are rather large (<m>\vec a_2(-1) = \la -6,30\ra</m>!)
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, we simply plot the locations of Object 1 and 2 on intervals of <m>1/5</m>th of a second,
          shown in <xref ref="fig_motion2b">Figure</xref>(a) and (b).
          Note how the <m>x</m>-values of Object 1 increase at a steady rate.
          This is because the <m>x</m>-component of <m>\vec a(t)</m> is 0;
          there is no acceleration in the <m>x</m>-component.
          The dots are not evenly spaced;
          the object is moving faster near <m>t=-1</m> and <m>t=1</m> than near <m>t=0</m>.

        <p>
          In part (b) of the Figure, we see the points plotted for Object 2.
          Note the large change in position from <m>t=-1</m> to <m>t=-0.8</m>;
          the object starts moving very quickly.
          However, it slows considerably at it approaches the origin,
          and comes to a complete stop at <m>t=0</m>.
          While it looks like there are 3 points near the origin,
          there are in reality 5 points there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the objects begin and end at the same location,
          they have the same displacement.
          Since they begin and end at the same time,
          with the same displacement,
          they have the same average rate of change (i.e, they have the same average velocity).
          Since they follow the same path,
          they have the same distance traveled.
          Even though these three measurements are the same,
          the objects obviously travel the path in very different ways.

                The ball whirls in a  circle.
                Since the string is 2ft long,
                the radius of the circle is 2.
                The position function <m>\vrt = \la 2\cos t, 2\sin t\ra</m> describes a circle with radius 2, centered at the origin,

                To find <m>\vat</m>, we take the derivative of <m>\vrt</m> twice.

                </md>.
                Note how <m>\vat</m> is parallel to \vec r(t),
                but has a different magnitude and points in the opposite direction.
                Why is this?
                Recall the classic physics equation,
                <q>Force <m>=</m> mass <times /> acceleration.</q>
                A force acting on a mass induces acceleration (i.e., the mass moves);
                acceleration acting on a mass induces a force
                (gravity gives our mass a <em>weight</em>).
                Thus force and acceleration are closely related.
                A moving ball <q>wants</q> to travel in a straight line.
                Why does the ball in our example move in a circle?
                It is attached to the boy's hand by a string.
                The string applies a force to the ball, affecting it's motion:
                the string <em>accelerates</em> the ball.
                This is not acceleration in the sense of
                <q>it travels faster;</q> rather,
                this acceleration is changing the velocity of the ball.
                In what direction is this force/acceleration being applied?
                In the direction of the string, towards the boy's hand.
                The magnitude of the acceleration is related to the speed at which the ball is traveling.
                A ball whirling quickly is rapidly changing direction/velocity.
                When velocity is changing rapidly,
                the acceleration must be <q>large.</q>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                When the boy releases the string,
                the string no longer applies a force to the ball,
                meaning acceleration is <m>\vec 0</m> and the ball can now move in a straight line in the direction of <m>\vec v(t)</m>.
                Let <m>t=t_0</m> be the time when the boy lets go of the string.
                The ball will be at <m>\vec r(t_0)</m>,
                traveling in the direction of <m>\vec v(t_0)</m>.
                We want to find <m>t_0</m> so that this line contains the point <m>(0,10)</m>
                (since the tree is 10ft directly in front of the boy).

                There are many ways to find this time value.
                We choose one that is relatively simple computationally.

      The objects in <xref ref="ex_motion3">Examples</xref>

      That is, <m>\norm{\vvt} = c</m> for some constant <m>c</m>.
      Recall <xref ref="thm_vects_of_constant_length">Theorem</xref>,
      which states that if a vector<ndash />valued function \vec r(t)<nbsp />has constant length,
      then \vec r(t)<nbsp />is perpendicular to its derivative:
      <m>\vrt\cdot\vrp(t) = 0</m>.
      In these examples, the velocity function has constant length,
      therefore we can conclude that the velocity is perpendicular to the acceleration:
      <m>\vvt\cdot\vat = 0</m>.
      A quick check verifies this.<idx><h>vector<ndash />valued function</h><h>of constant length</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p>
      There is an intuitive understanding of this.
      If acceleration is parallel to velocity,
      then it is only affecting the object's speed;
      it does not change the direction of travel.
      (For example, consider a dropped stone.
      Acceleration and velocity are parallel <mdash /> straight down <mdash /> and the direction of velocity never changes,
      though speed does increase.)
      If acceleration is not perpendicular to velocity,
      then there is some acceleration in the direction of travel,
      influencing the speed.
      If speed is constant, then acceleration must be orthogonal to velocity,
      as it then only affects direction, and not speed.

    <title>Projectile Motion</title>
    <p>
      An important application of vector<ndash />valued position functions is
      <em>projectile motion</em>:
      the motion of objects under only the influence of gravity.
      We will measure time in seconds,
      and distances will either be in meters or feet.
      We will show that we can completely describe the path of such an object knowing its initial position and initial velocity (i.e., where it <em>is</em>
      and where it <em>is going.</em>) <idx><h>vector<ndash />valued function</h><h>projectile motion</h></idx>
          <idx><h>projectile motion</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose an object has initial position
      <m>\vec r(0) = \la x_0,y_0\ra</m> and initial velocity <m>\vec v(0) = \la v_x,v_y\ra</m>.
      It is customary to rewrite
      <m>\vec v(0)</m> in terms of its speed <m>v_0</m> and direction <m>\vec u</m>,
      where <m>\vec u</m> is a unit vector.
      Recall all unit vectors in
      <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> can be written as <m>\la \cos \theta,\sin \theta\ra</m>,
      where <m>\theta</m> is an angle measure counter<ndash />clockwise from the <m>x</m>-axis. (We refer to <m>\theta</m> as the
      <em>angle of elevation.</em>
          <idx><h>angle of elevation</h></idx>
      ) Thus <m>\vec v(0) = v_0\la \cos \theta,\sin \theta\ra</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the acceleration of the object is known,
      namely <m>\vat = \la 0,-g\ra</m>,
      where <m>g</m> is the gravitational constant,
      we can find <m>\vrt</m> knowing our two initial conditions.

                We can compute average speed by dividing: 12.88/4 = 3.22m/s.

          How is <em>velocity</em> different from <em>speed</em>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Velocity is a vector,
          indicating an objects direction of travel and its rate of distance change (i.e., its speed).
          Speed is a scalar.

          What is the difference between <em>displacement</em>
          and <em>distance traveled</em>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Displacement is a vector,
          indicating the difference between the starting and ending positions of an object.
          Distance traveled is a scalar,
          indicating the arc length of the path followed.

        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The average velocity is found by dividing the displacement by the time traveled <mdash /> it is a vector.
          The average speed is found by dividing the distance traveled by the time traveled <mdash /> it is a scalar.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Describe a scenario where an object's average speed is a large number,
          but the magnitude of the average velocity is not a large number.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          One example is traveling at a constant speed <m>s</m> in a circle,
          ending at the starting position.
          Since the displacement is <m>\vec 0</m>,
          the average velocity is <m>\vec 0</m>, hence <m>\vnorm 0=0</m>.
          But traveling at constant speed <m>s</m> means the average speed is also <m>s >0</m>.

      </answer>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Explain why it is not possible to have an average velocity with a large magnitude but a small average speed.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Distance traveled is always greater than or equal to the magnitude of displacement,
          therefore average speed will always be at least as large as the magnitude of the average velocity.

          A Cessna flies at 1000ft at 150mph and drops a box of supplies to the professor
          (and his wife)
          on an island.
          Ignoring wind resistance,
          how far horizontally will the supplies travel before they land?
        </p>

      <answer>
        <p>
          The position function is <m>\vrt = \la 220t,-16t^2+1000\ra</m>.
          The <m>y</m>-component is 0 when <m>t=7.9</m>;
          <m>\vec r(7.9) = \la 1739.25,0\ra</m>,
          meaning the box will travel about 1740ft horizontally before it lands.
