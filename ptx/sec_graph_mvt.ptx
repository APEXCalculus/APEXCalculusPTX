  <title>The Mean Value Theorem</title>
  <p>
    We motivate this section with the following question: Suppose you leave your house and drive to your friend's house in a city <m>100</m> miles away,
    completing the trip in two hours.
    At any point during the trip do you necessarily have to be going <m>50</m> miles per hour?
  </p>

  <p>
    In answering this question,
    it is clear that the <em>average</em>
    speed for the entire trip is
    <quantity>
      <mag>50</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
    </quantity>
    (<ie/> <m>100</m> miles in <m>2</m> hours),
    but the question is whether or not your
    <em>instantaneous</em> speed is ever exactly
    <quantity>
      <mag>50</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
    </quantity>.
    More simply, does your speedometer ever read exactly
    <quantity>
      <mag>50</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
    </quantity>? The answer,
    under some very reasonable assumptions, is <q>yes.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's now see why this situation is in a calculus text by translating it into mathematical symbols.
  </p>

  <p>
    First assume that the function <m>y = f(t)</m> gives the distance
    (in miles)
    traveled from your home at time <m>t</m>
    (in hours)
    where <m>0\le t\le 2</m>.
    In particular, this gives <m>f(0)=0</m> and <m>f(2)=100</m>.
    The slope of the secant line connecting the starting and ending points
    <m>(0,f(0))</m> and <m>(2,f(2))</m> is therefore
    <md>
      <mrow>\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta t} \amp = \frac{f(2)-f(0)}{2-0}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \frac{100-0}{2}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = 50 \text{ mph}</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The slope at any point on the graph itself is given by the derivative <m>\fp(t)</m>.
    So, since the answer to the question above is <q>yes,</q>
    this means that at some time during the trip,
    the derivative takes on the value of
    <quantity>
      <mag>50</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
    </quantity>.
    Symbolically,
    <me>
      \fp(c) = \frac{f(2)-f(0)}{2-0} = 50
    </me>
    for some time <m>0\le c \le 2</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    How about more generally?
    Given any function <m>y=f(x)</m> and a range
    <m>a\le x\le b</m> does the value of the derivative at some point between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have to match the slope of the secant line connecting the points <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m>?
    Or equivalently, does the equation
    <m>\fp(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}</m> have to hold for some <m>a \lt c \lt b</m>?
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's look at two functions in an example.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex_mvt1">
    <title>Comparing average and instantaneous rates of change</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider functions
        <md>
          <mrow>f_1(x)\amp=\frac{1}{x^2}\amp f_2(x)\amp= \abs{x}</mrow>
        </md>
        with <m>a=-1</m> and <m>b=1</m> as shown in <xref ref="fig_mvt1"/>.
        Both functions have a value of <m>1</m> at <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
        Therefore the slope of the secant line connecting the end points is <m>0</m> in each case.
        But if you look at the plots of each,
        you can see that there are no points on either graph where the tangent lines have slope zero.
        Therefore we have found that there is no <m>c</m> in <m>[-1,1]</m> such that
        <me>
          \fp(c) = \frac{f(1)-f(-1)}{1-(-1)} = 0
        </me>.

            <description>
              <p>
                The graph illustrates the function <m>f_1(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}</m>, showcasing a scenario where the Mean Value Theorem is not applicable.
                As <m>x</m> approaches zero, the function demonstrates a vertical asymptote, highlighting its discontinuity and the tendency of the values to become infinite.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within the interval <m>[-1, 1]</m>, although the function's value is the same at both endpoints, there is no point where the function's derivative, which represents the slope of the tangent, is zero.
                This absence violates the Mean Value Theorem's requirement for the function to be both continuous on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval, specifically at <m>x = 0</m>.

                Displayed is the function <m>f_2(x) = \abs{x}</m>, chosen to highlight a case where the Mean Value Theorem cannot be applied.
                The graph forms a V shape, characteristic of the absolute value function, and is continuous over the interval <m>[-1, 1]</m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the endpoints of the interval, the function attains the same value, yielding a secant line with a slope of zero.
                However, due to the sharp corner at the origin <m>x = 0</m>, the function is not differentiable at this point.
                This lack of differentiability means that there does not exist a point in the interval where the slope of the tangent line is equal to the slope of the secant line, as required by the Mean Value Theorem.
                Thus, the function <m>f_2(x)</m> serves as an example of when the Mean Value Theorem's conditions are not fulfilled.

  <p>
    So what went <q>wrong</q>?
    It may not be surprising to find that the discontinuity of <m>f_1</m> and the corner of <m>f_2</m> play a role.
    If our functions had been continuous and differentiable,
    would we have been able to find that special value <m>c</m>?
    This is our motivation for the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_mvt">
    <title>The Mean Value Theorem of Differentiation</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>y=f(x)</m> be a continuous function on the closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on the open interval <m>(a,b)</m>.
        There exists a value <m>c</m>, <m>a \lt  c \lt  b</m>,

      <p>
        That is, there is a value <m>c</m> in <m>(a,b)</m> where the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m> is equal to the average rate of change of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Note that the reasons that the functions in <xref ref="ex_mvt1"/>
    fail are indeed that <m>f_1</m> has a discontinuity on the interval <m>[-1,1]</m> and <m>f_2</m> is not differentiable at the origin.

  <p>
    We will give a proof of the Mean Value Theorem below.
    To do so, we use a fact, called Rolle's Theorem, stated here.

    Consider <xref ref="fig_mvt3"/>
    where the graph of a function <m>f</m> is given, where <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>.
    It should make intuitive sense that if <m>f</m> is differentiable

    that there would be a value <m>c</m> in <m>(a,b)</m> where <m>\fp(c)=0</m>;

    Rolle's Theorem is really just a special case of the Mean Value Theorem.
    If <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>, then the <em>average</em>
    rate of change on <m>(a,b)</m> is <m>0</m>,
    and the theorem guarantees some <m>c</m> where <m>\fp(c)=0</m>.
    We will prove Rolle's Theorem,
    then use it to prove the Mean Value Theorem.
  </p>

  <proof>
    <title>Proof of Rolle's Theorem</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>f</m> be differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m> where <m>f(a)=f(b)</m>.
      We consider two cases.
    </p>
    <case>
      <p>
        Consider the case when <m>f</m> is constant on <m>[a,b]</m>;
        that is, <m>f(x) = f(a) = f(b)</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>.
        Then <m>\fp(x) = 0</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>,
        showing there is at least one value <m>c</m> in <m>(a,b)</m> where <m>\fp(c)=0</m>.
      </p>
    </case>
    <case>
      <p>
        Now assume that <m>f</m> is not constant on <m>[a,b]</m>.
        The Extreme Value Theorem guarantees that <m>f</m> has a maximal and minimal value on <m>[a,b]</m>,
        found either at the endpoints or at a critical value in <m>(a,b)</m>.
        Since <m>f(a)=f(b)</m> and <m>f</m> is not constant,
        it is clear that the maximum and minimum cannot <em>both</em>
        be found at the endpoints.
        Assume, without loss of generality,
        that the maximum of <m>f</m> is not found at the endpoints.
        Therefore there is a <m>c</m> in <m>(a,b)</m> such that <m>f(c)</m> is the maximum value of <m>f</m>.
        By <xref ref="thm_criticalpts"/>,
        <m>c</m> must be a critical number of <m>f</m>;
        since <m>f</m> is differentiable,
        we have that <m>\fp(c) = 0</m>,
        completing the proof of the theorem.
      </p>
    </case>
  </proof>


  <p>
    We can now prove the Mean Value Theorem.
  </p>

    <video width="98%" youtube="1b9af8q5JMg" xml:id="vid_graphs_MVT_proof_MVT" label="vid_graphs_MVT_proof_MVT" component="video"/>

    <p>
      Define the function
      <me>
        g(x) = f(x) - \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}x
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We know <m>g</m> is differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m> and continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> since <m>f</m> is.
      We can show <m>g(a)=g(b)</m> (it is actually easier to show <m>g(b)-g(a)=0</m>,
      which suffices).
      We can then apply Rolle's theorem to guarantee the existence of
      <m>c</m> in <m>(a,b)</m> such that <m>g'(c) = 0</m>.
      But note that
      <me>
        0= g'(c) = \fp(c) - \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
      </me>;
      hence
      <me>
        \fp(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
      </me>,
      which is what we sought to prove.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    Going back to the very beginning of the section,
    we see that the only assumption we would need about our distance function <m>f(t)</m> is that it be continuous and differentiable for <m>t</m> from <m>0</m> to <m>2</m> hours
    (both reasonable assumptions).
    By the <xref ref="thm_mvt"/>,
    we are guaranteed a time during the trip where our instantaneous speed is
    <quantity>
      <mag>50</mag><unit base="mileperhour"/>
    </quantity>.
    This fact is used in practice.
    Some law enforcement agencies monitor traffic speeds while in aircraft.
    They do not measure speed with radar,
    but rather by timing individual cars as they pass over lines painted on the highway whose distances apart are known.
    The officer is able to measure the <em>average</em>
    speed of a car between the painted lines;
    if that average speed is greater than the posted speed limit,
    the officer is assured that the driver exceeded the speed limit at some time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the <xref ref="thm_mvt"/>
    is an <em>existence</em> theorem.
    It states that a special value <m>c</m> <em>exists</em>,
    but it does not give any indication about how to find it.
    It turns out that when we need the <xref ref="thm_mvt"/>,
    existence is all we need.

            <p>
              This graph depicts the function <m>f(x) = x^3 + 5x + 5</m> over the interval <m>[-3, 3]</m>.
              The function is shown as a solid blue curve, and there is a black dashed line that represents the average rate of change of the function over the given interval.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two red dashed lines are drawn on the graph, indicating the tangent lines to the curve at the points where the function's derivative equals the average rate of change.
              These points, marked on the x-axis, are where the slope of the tangent is the same as the slope of the secant line (the black dashed line), which is the essence of the Mean Value Theorem.
              The exact points on the x-axis where these tangents touch the curve correspond to the solutions where <m>f'(x) = 3x^2 + 5</m> is set equal to 14, the average rate of change.

  <p>
    While the <xref ref="thm_mvt"/> has practical use
    (for instance,
    the speed monitoring application mentioned before),
    it is mostly used to advance other theory.
    We will use it in the next section to relate the shape of a graph to its derivative.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before ending this section, we give two important consequences of the Mean
    Value Theorem. Each of these consequences has important applications to
    mathematical theory, and can be easily understood in the context of the
    position and velocity of objects in motion.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, we recall that the derivative of any constant function is zero.
    Is the converse true? That is, are constant functions the only ones whose derivative is zero?
    The Mean Value Theorem says <em>yes</em>.
    This officially
    establishes our intuition about objects in (or, actually, <em>not</em> in)
    motion: if the velocity of an object is <m>0</m>, then the object's position is
    unchanged; it is constant.
    Second, if two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have the same derivative,
    what does this tell us about <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>?
    The Mean Value Theorem implies that these functions must only differ by a constant;
    that is, <m>f(x)=g(x)+C</m>, for some constant <m>C</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This has an application to motion that is not intuitive to some. Suppose
    two objects start moving while <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> apart,
    and always move with the same velocity.
    Then the two objects will <em>always</em> be <quantity><mag>5</mag><unit base="foot"/></quantity> apart.
    (If two pennies are dropped from the 30th and 31st stories of a tall building at
    the same time, they will always be 1 story apart as they fall.)

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>, and <m>h</m> be differentiable
        (and therefore continuous) functions on an in terval <m>I</m>.
        <ol>

              If <m>\fp(x)=0</m> for all <m>x</m> in the interval <m>I</m>,
              then <m>f</m> is a constant function on <m>I</m>.

              If <m>g'(x)=g'(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in <m>I</m>,
              then there is a constant <m>C</m> such that <m>g(x)=h(x)+C</m>

        <ol>

            <p>
              Choose any two points <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in the interval <m>I</m>.
              By the <xref ref="thm_mvt" text="custom">Mean Value Theorem</xref>,
              we must have
              <me>
                \fp(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
              </me>
              for some <m>c</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
              But <m>\fp(c)=0</m>, so <m>f(b)-f(a)=0</m>, or <m>f(a)=f(b)</m>.
              Since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> were any two points,
              this tells us that <m>f</m> must have the same value at every point;
              that is, <m>f</m> must be constant.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose <m>g'(x)=h'(x)</m> for each point <m>x</m> in <m>I</m>,
              and consider the function <m>f(x)=g(x)-h(x)</m>.
              By the difference rule for derivatives, we have
              <me>
                f'(x) = g'(x)-h'(x)=0
              </me>,
              since <m>g'(x)=h'(x)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              By the previous result, this means that <m>f(x)</m> is a constant function.
              That is, <m>f(x)=C</m> for each <m>x</m> in <m>I</m>, giving us
              <m>g(x)-h(x)=C</m>, or <m>g(x)=h(x)+C</m>.
