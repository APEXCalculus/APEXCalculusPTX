	<title>A Brief History of Calculus</title>
	<p>
		<em>Calculus</em> means <q>a method of calculation or reasoning.</q>
		When one computes the sales tax on a purchase,
		one employs a simple calculus.
		When one finds the area of a polygonal shape by breaking it up into a set of triangles,
		one is using another calculus.
		Proving a theorem in geometry employs yet another calculus.
	</p>

	<p>
		Despite the wonderful advances in mathematics that had taken place into the first half of the 17th century,
		mathematicians and scientists were keenly aware of what they <em>could not do.</em>
		(This is true even today.) In particular,
		two important concepts eluded mastery by the great thinkers of that time:
		area and rates of change.
	</p>

	<p>
		Area seems innocuous enough;
		areas of circles, rectangles, parallelograms,
		etc., are standard topics of study for students today just as they were then.
		However, the areas of <em>arbitrary</em>
		shapes could not be computed,
		even if the boundary of the shape could be described exactly.
	</p>

	<p>
		Rates of change were also important.
		When an object moves at a constant rate of change,
		then <q><m>\text{distance} = \text{rate}\times\text{time}</m>.</q>
		But what if the rate is not constant<mdash />can distance still be computed?
		Or, if distance is known, can we discover the rate of change?
	</p>

	<p>
		It turns out that these two concepts were related.
		Two mathematicians, Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz,
		are credited with independently formulating a system of computing that solved the above problems and showed how they were connected.
		Their system of reasoning was <q>a</q> calculus.
		However, as the power and importance of their discovery took hold,
		it became known to many as <q>the</q> calculus.
		Today, we generally shorten this to discuss <q>calculus.</q>
