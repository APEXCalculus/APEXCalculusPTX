  <title>Functions of Several Variables</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      There are many situations where a desired quantity is a function of two or more variables.
      For instance,
      wind chill is measured by knowing the temperature and wind speed;
      the volume of a gas can be computed knowing the pressure and temperature of the gas;
      to compute a baseball player's batting average,
      one needs to know the number of hits and the number of at<ndash />bats.
    </p>

    <p>
      This chapter studies <em>multivariable</em> functions, that is,
      functions with more than one input.
