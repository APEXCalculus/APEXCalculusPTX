  <title>Introduction to Functions of Several Variables</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A function of the form <m>y=f(x)</m> is a function of a single variable;
      given a value of <m>x</m>, we can find a value <m>y</m>.
      Even the vector-valued functions of <xref ref="chap_vvf"/>
      are single-variable functions;
      the input is a single variable though the output is a vector.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many situations where a desired quantity is a function of two or more variables.
      For instance,
      wind chill is measured by knowing the temperature and wind speed;
      the volume of a gas can be computed knowing the pressure and temperature of the gas;
      to compute a baseball player's batting average,
      one needs to know the number of hits and the number of at-bats.
    </p>

    <p>
      This chapter introduces <em>multivariable</em> functions, that is,
      functions with more than one input.
      A more detailed study of differential calculus for multivariable functions continues in <xref ref="chapter_multi_UL4"/>.
